What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?,"While time spent at college is a happy experience for most , the university life is not without its rough patches . Starting university is like starting a new life . Everyone 's situation is unique , but there are a few problems that almost all college students deal with at least once during their time at university . In my opinion , homesickness , social problems and time management are among the most important sufferings of university life . @DATE @DATE @DATE of university is always extra hard and most students will at @CARDINAL point get homesick and depressed , especially those who attend a university far away from their hometown . Freshmen suffer more , as it is presumably @DATE @DATE @DATE away from their home , family and friends . If a student is lucky enough , he / she will make many new friends , because establishing connections and spending time with friends is important for building community . Otherwise , it will be more difficult for the student to go through the university period with all its other difficulties . University is academically challenging . The courses require much more effort and planning than high school classes . Most students do not have enough time to manage their activities . They sleep erratically and do everything at @TIME @TIME @TIME ; that is what leads them to an unhealthy and unplanned life .

What are the characteristics of bad teachers?,"Bad teachers , for sure , are one of the main reasons why students hate school . These kinds of teachers often do n't have organization skills and class management and this way they turn school into a frustrating and embarrassing environment .

Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?,"The power of money in solving important and fundamental problems of life is transient and permanent . There is a general belief , especially among poor people , that every problem can be solved by money . Having money is great ; It is true that the role of it , in meeting some basic human needs is undeniable , but I personally believe that it is primitive and wrong to think that money is the solution to all problems , because there are some disease - related and emotion - based problems that can not be met through money . There are various incurable and sometimes fatal diseases , which unfortunately can not be cured even by paying a large amount of money . Diseases such as diabetes , AIDS , some cancers , mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and genetic diseases such as Down syndrome and autism have yet to be cured . Many people , all over the world , suffer from such diseases , but money can not save or cure them . Not only physical illnesses but also many mental and emotional problems can not be solved with money . For someone who feels lonely , money does not accompany or for those who suffer from depression , money does not bring happiness . There are those who got divorced and unfortunately no amount of money can ever fix relations between people . There are many mental and emotional problems that money can never solve . Overall , Money is just a tool which is used for living and making things easier , however , in fact , it does not solve all problems . Money will sort out financial stresses a person may have , but obviously it can not buy him / her happiness and will not sort out all emotional and pathological problems ; definitely it can not buy a person contentment with his / herself . So , money may lessen problems , but it does not solve all .",9.0,9.0,8.5,9.0

What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?,"Studying at university will certainly be fraught with problems that students will have to deal with . In my opinion , conditions are naturally more difficult for those who study in a city other than their hometown . The most important problems of these students , in addition to the cost of education , are accommodation and homesickness . Each student has to prepare relevant books to study in any field . Fortunately , nowadays , due to the development of technology and easier access to the Internet , students are able to purchase books for free or buy them at a lower price . Students , who live in dormitories , have group life ; some items such as bathroom and kitchen are shared between them , which makes it hard for some of these students to endure university life . In my opinion , living in dormitories is one of the main reasons which causes homesickness , boredom and unhappiness . For students who have left their hometown to study , it is most of the times annoying to be away from their family and friends . Just as advances in technology have minimized the enormous cost of preparing books for students , so too have advances made it possible for them to communicate with families and friends more easily than before , which mostly relieves their homesickness . University life has many problems that every student has to deal with in order to get through his / her studies well . If a student is not strong enough to cope with such living conditions , he / she can easily become exhausted and dropping out of university is the least of the consequences .",6.0,6.5,6.5,6.5

Thus , if you want a life of luxury , without money , it would be very difficult to live a comfortable life and hence it is easy to understand why people work very hard these days to earn money . This point of view about money which can solve all the problems leads to @CARDINAL @CARDINAL conclusion that money is an extremely valuable tool in the modern life . It is absolutely important and solve many problems and because of that people work hard for many hours to earn money for solving their problems and have comfortable life . On the other side of the argument , some people believe that there are many things which are the most important such as happiness , forgiveness , and also humanity . Having money is good but expecting that it can solve all the problems is completely wrong . I believe happiness and the ability of forgiveness are the most important factors that can solve the problems and can make worth living . If you learn how to be happy and also how to forgive others then you have achieved everything in your life . If you are depressed and not balanced in your life , what is the use of @CARDINAL in your bank account ? Money can not buy everlasting life . It can not buy you good health , a life of free disease such as cancer , heart disease , etc . It can not also buy humanity , although in the modern life money means many things . When we understand the reason of creating human , we can conclude money is just one of the tools that will help human for having better life . In conclusion , in the modern society with complex problems money and earning more is very important but it can not solve all problems . Money is good , but just ask yourself what other things can solve your problems ? To recapitulate , there many things in our life which are irreplaceable and you can not exchange them with money . We live in a world that is surrounded by positive characteristics . Few of us think that money is everything and can solve all problems , but I personally believe money has a minor effect on our life .",6.0,6.5,6.5,6.5
What are the characteristics of bad teachers?,"We will hope that all teachers are excellent , and effective persons . Students have all experienced good and bad teachers . What qualities can consider a teacher ineffective or bad ? I think bad teachers may have @CARDINAL characteristics ; they lack of classroom management , lack of motivation skills , and also lack of professionalism . @ORDINAL , lack of classroom management is the probably the biggest failure of a bad teacher . When a teacher does not have the ability to control students in the classroom , he or she can not create effective opportunities for transferring information students . Simply , if teachers can not manage pupils in their classroom they will not be able to teach them effectively . In conclusion , classroom management plays an important role in teaching profession . Lack of classroom management skills influences teaching and learning . @ORDINAL , bad teachers do not the abilities to create an environment which can motivate learners and as the consequence they demotivate their students . Sometimes it happens that children lose their motivation for learning because they do not receive any attentions from their teachers . In short , because the bad teachers lack the ability to encourage learners , they are known as ineffective educators . @ORDINAL , lack of professionalism can quickly lead a teacher 's dismissal . Teachers who are routinely absent or tardy are ineffective . They can not do their job if they are not there to do it . Briefly , a professional behavior shows you take your responsibilities seriously . Failing to act professionally sets a bad example and may cause you to lose the trust and respect of students . To recapitulate , we as a student wishes that all teachers are perfect . But it happens that pupils have bad educators too . An unprofessional teacher who does not have classroom management skills , ability to motivate , and lack professionalism can adversely affect the attitude of students toward learning and teaching .",7.5,8.0,8.0,8.0

Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?,"In @DATE 's world , money plays an important role in human 's lives . Some people think that the most important basic human needs such as food , clothing and housing can be solved by money . But I believe that more major needs , such as human 's health and learning different sciences , can not always be met through money . Men really need health before education , food , clothing and material needs . Only a healthy person can continue studying , working and eventually surviving . Sometimes the cost of treating some diseases is so high that not everyone can afford it , so they suffer the disease and eventually die . But there are other cases in which the disease is incurable that not even great wealth can save human beings . It 's true that studying , like many other things , in the @ORDINAL place is possible with money ; but not all those who have an educational document are literate ; some people are able to obtain a forged document by paying lots of money and believe that they have achieved what they wanted with wealth . However , experience is not something that can be bought , it 's gained during the time by studying a lot .

It 's too hard to earn money for a daily normal life just for @CARDINAL person , let alone a family !

It is possible to be single for all your life and be happy. We do not need to get married. Do you agree or disagree? Why?,"Happiness is an emotional state characterized by feelings of joy , satisfaction and also fulfillment . @ORG may become dependent on someone else , or by doing or obtaining something . But when you understand the definition of happiness clearly and embody it , you make better decisions and consequently your life become enriched . Although it is possible to be single for all your life and be happy , I disagree with this idea . I believe with a good marriage , which has some characteristics such as empathy , forgiveness , trustfulness , and also respect , you can be happy and make a happy life . Empathy is the ability to relate to how someone else is feeling ; in fact to be able to put yourself in their shoes . It is crucial for any marriage to survive with some weaknesses , as it is an essential part of truly understanding another person . When you understand your partner in difficult situations , for example , you feel his or her reactions too . In a word , by truly understanding another person , you can be happy and enjoy your life . Another factor for being happy with marriage is forgiveness . Obviously , forgiveness means you forgive the fault s of your partner in the life but not always . When you look back and recall all mistakes in your life , you inject the bad feelings and also unhappiness emotions in your mind . In brief , by forgiveness in your life , you liberate yourself form any bad feelings and bring joyfulness in your life . A further fact that I think with a good marriage we can be happy too is trustfulness . Basically , trust means you have a strong feeling and also belief in honest of someone . I believe mutual connection can bring trust in your maternal life . @ORG is the quality o always speaking the truth and being transparent in your words and actions . When you say what you want directly , you relaxed yourself in your life and make happy moments with your partner . In brief , honesty in a relationship means always telling your partner the truth and being totally open with them . The final reason for being happy with marriage is respect .

This may be true , but in most lives the man has the power and the woman is a cook for the family or a nurse for the children . These days people live alone and independent of their family , because this way they can be more free . And for filling their lonliness , some of them take care of a pet . Maybe they think keeping a pet costs them less than having a child ! I do n't agree with being single and keeping pets in order to escape from loneliness , but despite all the problems that I , as a woman , may face in my single life , I believe that marriage deprives humans ' freedom by making commitment ; men and women are forced to give up their own purposes by working hard all the time in @DATE 's society to stay alive .",6.5,6.0,6.5,6.5

Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?,"The power of money in solving important and fundamental problems of life is transient and permanent . There is a general belief , especially among poor people , that every problem can be solved by money . Having money is great ; It is true that the role of it , in meeting some basic human needs is undeniable , but I personally believe that it is primitive and wrong to think that money is the solution to all problems , because there are some disease - related and emotion - based problems that can not be met through money . There are various incurable and sometimes fatal diseases , which unfortunately can not be cured even by paying a large amount of money . Diseases such as diabetes , AIDS , some cancers , mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and genetic diseases such as Down syndrome and autism have yet to be cured . Many people , all over the world , suffer from such diseases , but money can not save or cure them . Not only physical illnesses but also many mental and emotional problems can not be solved with money . For someone who feels lonely , money does not accompany or for those who suffer from depression , money does not bring happiness . There are those who got divorced and unfortunately no amount of money can ever fix relations between people . There are many mental and emotional problems that money can never solve . Overall , Money is just a tool which is used for living and making things easier , however , in fact , it does not solve all problems .

"What kind of climate do you prefer to live in? Cold, warm, or temperate? Why?","Human live in the earth , as result they have experienced different climates such as : Cold , warm , or temperate .

I have some reasons for my claim , such as : living in temperate climate can speed the working rate , or living in this type of weather is more healthy than the other ones . But we should not ignore some bad effects too . There are some positive points in living in temperate climate . Because in this type of weather you do not have too warm or too cold days , you can properly in your workplace . Another positive point of temperate climate is that it does not have crucial diseases ; for example living in warm climate can bring some disease for human such as dehydrate human 's body . Living in cold climate is the same , it can bring some sicknesses such as : catching cold , sore throat . Although I prefer to live in temperate climate , there is negative point too . Living in temperate weather can bring some weakness for your body , or it is better to say it can reduce the working of the human 's organs , because these organs in human 's body need different temperatures .

What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?,"Studying at university will certainly be fraught with problems that students will have to deal with . In my opinion , conditions are naturally more difficult for those who study in a city other than their hometown . The most important problems of these students , in addition to the cost of education , are accommodation and homesickness . Each student has to prepare relevant books to study in any field . Fortunately , nowadays , due to the development of technology and easier access to the Internet , students are able to purchase books for free or buy them at a lower price . Students , who live in dormitories , have group life ; some items such as bathroom and kitchen are shared between them , which makes it hard for some of these students to endure university life . In my opinion , living in dormitories is one of the main reasons which causes homesickness , boredom and unhappiness . For students who have left their hometown to study , it is most of the times annoying to be away from their family and friends .

There are so many potential benefits that come with a college education . I , personally , believe that the most important benefits of going to university are job prospects as well as an effective development of social relations . Having a higher education degree provides people more job prospects . Those , who have the degree , are more likely to find the job they are looking for and thus grow their economy and earn money . Employers may assume a person is better qualified for higher - paying jobs if he / she has a degree even if the degree is not related to what he / she has be doing on the job . On average , people with college degrees make more than people without college degrees . University is not all about the job prospects , it is also a golden opportunity to meet new people .

However , it has become a controversial issue that whether animals should be prevented from involving in experimentation and killed or not . As far as I am concerned , I deem that animals must be preserved , which I will explicate in the upcoming paragraphs .   On the @CARDINAL hand , all living beings have an equal right to live and animals also include in this class . Therefore , if any person eats the herbivores or carnivores , it is against the elementary right of living . Additionally , technology , nowadays , has emerged as a power which may have distinctive alternatives to do experiments instead on animals , which can be beneficial to stabilize the number of these creatures . Besides , the religious belief is associated with the view to not eat the animals . To elaborate it , some people who are related to some specific religion deny to feed on animals as it is against their religion . For an instance , @NORP masses refrain from eating cow since it is considered as a god among them . Consequently , research on animals is argued .   On the flip side , some individuals assert that animals are a good source of protein and vitamins . Therefore , these are eaten by human beings which is helpful to remain healthy . For example , chicken is prescribed by many doctors to the patients who have fracture as it is fruitful to get strong bones . Along with this , animals have some characteristics identical to humans , which can not be found in any other living beings . Thus , they are the one on whom the research can be done easily to prepare any medicine . These are the factors why animal experimentation and feeding is supported .   In compendium , although it is advocated that there is nothing wrong in doing research work in addition to eating the animals , I am in favour of protecting the animals from experiments and becoming the food of the masses .",8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0

Opponents of animal abuse - sometimes called "" animal right activists "" - claim that animal in both food production and research activities have to suffer severe pain or even be killed since these activities require a wide range of chemical substances used for these animals . Moreover , a majority of livestock is beaten during food production activities , which is against moral values . For example , cows raised on farm have to endure terrifying , painful , and cruel procedure to make dairy products . Furthermore , these kinds of food are not essential as there are more alternatives which supplies more nutrients than animal meat ; for example nuts , mushrooms , and beans .   Meanwhile , those who support the expansion of animal exploitation claim that animals used for research activities may be greatly beneficial for human beings . To be more specific , scientists could find new vaccines and drugs preventing terrible diseases by doing research on animals . This means that doctor have more chance to cure more patients who are severely ill , which could improve public health . In fact , scientists in the @GPE have explored a new vaccine for cancer treatment after testing on rabbits . Animal exploitation proponents also claim that the improvement of public health means that there is less burden to society .   In conclusion , while there are convincing arguments on both sides of the debate , I would argue that human uses of animal are necessary . It is not realistic for people to find alternatives for these activities .",6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0

Should these animals not respond positively to these experimental trials , they are not carried out on human beings . This example clearly shows that human beings are more superior than animals and thus subject to exploitation .   On the other hand , those who think animals have equal right as humans opine that most of the reasons for predating on these animals are unnecessary . They argue , for instance , that most of the essential food nutrients needed by humans can be derived from fruits and vegetables which have even been scientifically proven to be more beneficial than animal products .

And that makes a vast number of humans to be sympathetic towards them as animals can not express their agony . For instance a lactating cow is not allowed to feed her calf at content , as the milk is supposed to make a good dairy business for a man and perhaps it is immoral eventually No human would do that to their infants .

However , this group believes that animals should not be endangered by humans , while some others point that human needs are more important and people should be allowed to use animals for their different purposes . Therefore , this essay has tried to cover both of mentioned views and would suggest a good way to solve the issue .   According to most of the history documents , the human has employed animals to have a better life from the time that civilisation has come to existence . In fact , the skin of animals has been considered as the @ORDINAL material for clothing industry and human has used the meat of them as a delicious food . @DATE @DATE , people spend money for these purposes and in addition scientists conduct most of their biology experiments on animals to find cures for illnesses .

Yet in the modern world , animals still offer an efficient and indispensable mean for scientists to develop killing edge vaccinations . Whether to ban the exploitation of animals in general or to continue profiting from them for the betterment of people 's lives still a matter of dispute .

Some argue that animals deserve to be treated the same way as humans , while others contend that humans must employ animals to fulfil their numerous needs . Both points of views will be analysed in this essay before a reasoned conclusion is drawn .   On the @CARDINAL hand , fair treatment of animals appears to be the moral thing to do . For example , animal rights activists groups have repeatedly performed studies that demonstrate that animals , when subjected to macabre conditions of slaughterhouses and laboratories , feel the pain in the same manner as human beings . Since most humans would never support the idea of inflicting such pain on their fellow human beings , it is only fair that animals should also be spared from this torment . When looking at this side of the argument , it is obvious why some support this stance .   On the other hand , many people opine that animals should be exploited in order to fulfil a number of human needs including food and research activities . Take pharmaceutical industry , for example , if humans stop testing drugs on animals to ensure their safety for subsequent human use , fatal damage could be caused to human beings as a result of using unsafe medicines . As without such medicines , the life expectancy of humans can fall dramatically , it is understandable why this point of view has garnered support .

On the @CARDINAL hand , a group of people believe that mankind does not have the rights to exploit animals , as they are also living creatures . It is true that animals live by following their instinct , but they have the same feeling as human beings , therefore it would not be fair for mankind to exploit them .

In another reported cases , some of the animals was treated poorly by their masters , though they had been exploited heavily and made them sick or injured .   On the other hand , it is undeniable that mankind needs the assistant of animals in various kinds of ways . @ORDINAL , some animals are needed by humans to assist them in producing and providing foods . In many countries , cows , buffalos or horses are used by farmers to cultivate their farming areas , and some dairy farms animals such as chicken and sheep are slaughtered for their meats .

Thanks to this act of conservation by the people . In my opinion , it is very essential for us to not let people exploit any animal , because it is the duty of people to protect them and yes they should also have their rights so that people do not misuse certain animals .   While there are many people who want to save the animals by putting a ban on their exploitation , there are others who argue that they must use them to satisfy their needs such as food and research . As it is true that animals are required for our basic needs , but they should also be protected , because of the growing concern regarding global warming , we should minimise the consumption of meat in order to sustain our planet . As far as research is concerned , the associations should put a regulation on what can be used for research and how much of it can be used for the same . A recent study shows that by the @DATE most of our resources will diminish and sea levels will be at its highest . In order to avoid using animals as a food source scientists have now started growing meat in labs . By taking out one cell of a single animal , they have successfully grown meat in a laboratory . It is extremely necessary to take measures and avoid using animals as food source .   In conclusion , this essay suggests that animals should n't be exploited for human purposes and that using them for food source and research work should be very limited and should be under the observation of the righteous authorities . Conservation of animals is important for a better and sustainable world .",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

On the @CARDINAL hand , some people think that well - being of a human is paramount , thus life and needs of a mankind should be prioritized over the animals ' rights . In other words , humanity tend to use animals in various ways to satisfy basic needs which , consequently , may lead to extinction of animals . To illustrate , some people serve them as food to overcome hunger , some corporations even use them as testing samples to observe reaction which some component may occur . Furthermore , being driven to exploit animals may be vital in order to survive in cold climatic zones where temperature degrees go as low as -50 Celsius . People are not able to exist in such temperatures without help of an animal , they frequently use animals ' fur and fat to get warmer .   On the other hand , some people think that rights of animals should be taken into account , because otherwise number of endangered species will rise dramatically and I agree . The planet @LOC is settled by @CARDINAL of species such as humans , animals and plants . In that matter , moderate functioning is possible only when each of them is in balance . By that I emphasize importance , which animals bring into our life . For example , if snakes had not existed , other species would have not destroyed , as a result flora and fauna will be in danger . In addition , more and more people prefer to keep an animal such as cat or dog for living a versatile life full of adventures .

This , in turn , by analysing reactions on an animal , they can make changes in composition of drugs . Moreover , there are few specific vitamins and nutritions , which are only getting from animals rather than from fruits and vegetables . Hence , in order to acquire particular benefits , non - vegetarians are ready to kill and digest creatures .   To infer and give my opinion , I would say that , with fast - paced of technology in every realm , we can find other ways to test medicines and have specific vitamins from other sources instead of falling innocent animals , which are the predominant part of the nature .",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

Some individuals think that these living creatures need to be made use of , for the gain of mankind , while others believe that these animals have the exact equal rights to live on the planet , just like any other homo sapiens . In this essay , I will discuss the merits and de - merits of both these arguments and discuss why it is important to not harm or utilise the animals for our own good .   Even though , it is unethical to utilise animals for fulfilling the needs of mankind , there are a few advantages to it . @ORDINAL , animals are considered a good source of energy that can be tapped to provide with sufficient labour . For example , it is widely known that animals are majorly employed in farming and other laborious works in many developing countries like @GPE . @ORDINAL , animals can act as a source of food for the society by providing their meat , which in turn can help reduce the dependence of the society on the cultivated crops . Finally , in recent times , animals with the same genetic system as human beings are being increasingly used in laboratories for testing . To exemplify , it is an accepted fact that lab rats were used to discover the drug for @GPE virus strand in @DATE .   However , there are a lot more de - merits of it . Not only does exploitation , harm the natural ecosystem of the environment , but also can result in the extinction or endangering of a few species . For instance , with exploitation of the farm animals and other domestic animals , it would directly result in the dwindling of their population and consequently harm the ecosystem . Likewise , hunting of wild animals would end up with the same consequence . Additionally , all animal beings are living creatures , who have the right to live just like every human being . Therefore , we can not exploit them for our own good .   To conclude , exploiting the animals for our benefits have a lot of negatives and hence needs to be stopped altogether .

However , modern society feels that animals should not be killed anymore , which is not right according to me .   @ORDINAL , humans kill animals for imperative purposes , for instance animal 's body parts are being used by Doctors to evolve new medicines and to cure some dangerous diseases which are essential for the survival of humans . If animals will not be killed , then there population will get abundant which will be dangerous for both human and nature .   In addition , Scientists and doctors use to do their research and tests on the animals , so they can find the flaws before applying that on humans . If they directly apply that on humans , then it will lead to be a serious issue for the society . Eventually , these all are for the welfare of humans .   On the contrary , Due to after killing of animals , some species of animals are on endangered state and some of them have already been extinct , which includes some beautiful species like stingray , so Humans are destroying the nature . We can not ignore the fact that animals have feelings too , and they are also a creation of god , so it is cruel to kill animals .   So it can be concluded , Despite the fact that animals have feelings , humans need to kill them for their own welfare and it is necessary for the survival of humans , but they must avoid excess killing of animals and killing of rare or endangered species to retain the beauty of our nature .",6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0

In other words , artists require help because the revenue generated can not be sufficient to effectively provide the services required of them .

The management complained that lack of support from the governing bodies resulted in the high gate fee   In other words , the government can provide various machinery and other high end equipments , consequently , this will help the doctors and nurses carry out their job effortlessly and provide outstanding results .

For example , a recent study by @ORG @ORG @ORG found that the extinction of different species animals due to animal testing and killing for different purposes .

Many important medical discoveries involved experimentations on animals . @CARDINAL clear example is finding the treatments of many diseases . If medical and scientific research has not been developed , humans suffering from illness could have not been cured . For this reason , medical tests and scientific studies are crucial on new drugs . In the @GPE , for instance , scientists found new elements of the cancer investigation , and they might have to do a test on animals .

On the other hand , animals play an important role in research because that can ensure the precise of products or study before publishing and discourage the least other sides . For example , in complex surgery , doctors or experts need to do experiments on animals in order to have some results or action and consider before taking action on human . Besides testing on human in cosmetics industry is banned so testing on animals is the best choice . Moreover , animals are main resource for food because they provide a certain source of nutrition and energy . Especially , in some areas such as the ethnic group , the locals having a low salary job must hunt animals so as to manage their life .   On the other hand , it is acceptable that animals who are born and exist have the same rights as human . They should not be behave badly and should live with humans to support each other . It is proved that when humans grow up a pet and live together , it helps people to reduce stress and the capicity of cancer . In the world , there are a lot of situation that doctors use animals treatment . When patients suffer from disorders or expression , unability , they live with a pet who enable them to have better life and become more optimistic . Besides , animals create the natural environments . If human continue hunting animals such as wild animals and destroy forests , the nature and the fresh air will disappear , leading to lose the nature and the pollution . As a result , misusing animals not only lose the nature but also make people behave unnormally .   In conclusion , as for as I am concerned that animals have rights to live and humans should respect them . However , people can limit the use of animals on research and replace food from meat to vegetables and vitamins .",6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0
"A growing number of people feel that animals should not be exploited by people and that they should have the same rights as humans, while others argue that humans must employ animals to satisfy their various needs, including uses for food and research. Discuss both views and give your opinion. 3","The vegan idea that animals and humans should be treated as equal , where the former are never used to benefit the latters , is becoming popular . Conversely , some people claim that humans need to use animals either for eating or for scientific experiments . This essay is going to explain these @CARDINAL points of view and then give my opinion .   On the @CARDINAL hand , animals should have the same rights than humans since they are equally important for our planet . For example , we would not survive if all the bees , tiny insects , were extinct . Hence , we should respect and love all forms of life in our universe because we depend on them . Killing an animal should be the same than killing a human being .   On the other hand , humans need to eat certain substances to survive , such as protein , which is easier to obtain in large quantities by eating the meat of animals such as cows and pigs . Not mention the chemical tests that the pharmaceutical industry needs to apply on animals , for instance . Since , testing these substances in humans is illegal . For these reasons , animals are needed , otherwise our specie would be endangered .   To conclude , I totally agree that animals should be employed to serve human needs as they are an asset to our lives . However , we should look after our environment and biodiversity in order to guarantee that we can continue to exploit them in the future .",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

Some people believe that animals should be treated in the same way humans are and have similar rights , whereas others think that it is more important to use them as we desire for the meal and medical research . This essay will discuss both points of view .   With regard to the exploitation of animals , people believe it is acceptable for several reasons . @ORDINAL , they think that humans are the most important beings on the planet , and everything must be done to ensure human survival . If this means experimenting on animals so that we can fight and find cures for diseases , then this takes priority over animal suffering . Furthermore , it is believed by some animals that do not feel pain or loss as humans do , so if we have to kill animals for foodstuff or other uses , then this is morally acceptable .   However , I do not believe these arguments stand up to scrutiny . Initially , it has been shown on numerous occasions by secret filming in laboratories via animal rights groups that animals feel as much pain as humans do , and they suffer when they are kept in cages for long periods . In addition , a substantial amount of animal research is done for cosmetics , not to find cures for diseases , so this is unnecessary . Finally , it has been proven that humans can get all the nutrients and vitamins that they need from green vegetables and fruit . Therefore , again , having to kill animals for cooking is not an adequate argument .   To sum up , although some people argue killing animals for research and cuisine is ethical , I would argue there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that is not the case , and , therefore , steps must be taken to improve the rights of animals .",7.5,7.5,7.5,7.5

This essay will discuss both the viewpoints and provide an opinion .   On the one hand people say that have the same right as humans and should therefore be protected against the cruel treatment on behalf of humans . Moreover , all living things make up a balanced ecosystem and all things have rightful place and consideration . Animals are sentient being as well . Like humans , they have the ability to express emotions such as pain , fear , happiness , and despair . To prove this fact , there have been several experiments done on animals which clearly proves that they feel the same amount of suffering and loss as humans do .   On the other hand , some people think that animals provide various needs of people . @ORDINAL , human population exploits a number of animals for food , including pig , cow and chicken poultry . They are being raised as a food and provide products that are important to everyday life . For example , is the pork , it is widely consumed meat in the world and people eat different products like bacon , sausage and pork chop . @ORDINAL , animals attributed to many lifesaving cures and treatments . Animal testing aids researchers in finding drugs and treatments to improve health and medicine . Take for instance , dogs had their pancreas removed led directly to the discovery of insulin , which help to save critical cases of people with diabetics .   In conclusion , people has their different views towards the exploitation of animals , others argue that animals should be treated same as human while others do not .

This essay outlines the differences between animals and humans and explains why there should be an equilibrium between the @CARDINAL .   On @CARDINAL hand , more and more people think that animals should not be exploited and that they should be treated as humans , having the same rights . Moreover , this implies that animals should have the right to own a property , vote , or even decide over their own choices in life . Nonetheless , I tend to disagree with this argument , because animals do not own a concience like ours , thereby they do n't have the ability to think as a humans does , thus they can not choose who their lider should be or how many acres of land they might need .   On the other hand , others think that animals should be like slaves , and there should be no interdictions on what we can do with them in order to satisfy our needs . Furthermore , this means that we can use these other life forms just for our well being . For example , using them for their meat and other foods they can produce , research , like drug research , or just other scientific projects that use animals as test subjects . Me personally , I can not say that I entirely agree with this type of thinking , because it 's not , in my opinion , the right way treat animals . We should , however , treat them like cohabitants of this earth we share and have a respectfull relationship , trying to live toghether in symbiosis with both parts benefiting upon each other .

Discuss both views and give your opinion. ","Throughout history , people have had a conflicted relationship with animals , adoring them as pets and yet exploiting them for food , entertainment and as research subjects . While some feel that this abuse is justified , others are strongly opposed . In this essay , I will discuss these views and explain why I feel that we should reduce our reliance on animals .   Many people claim that animals exist solely for our use and therefore , have few , if any , rights . The food industry , for instance , relies on the mass production of animals , most of which are kept in cramped and sometimes appalling conditions , which sometimes amount to torture . Since these animals are destined for slaughter anyway , some argue that their quality of life is irrelevant . The medical , scientific and cosmetics industries also use animals as objects , conducting painful and often fatal experiments on them , with little regard for their rights . Many people feel that the results of such tests are crucial to humankind and thus justify this inhumane treatment .   Despite this , others , myself included , feel that this exploitation of animals ought to be reconsidered . As they are sentient beings , capable of feelings and relationships , they deserve more respect . To achieve this , although Veganism may not suit everyone , it is certainly possible for people to cut down on meat consumption or at least make more ethical choices . In medical research too , the aim should be to reduce animal use , refine techniques and to replace them with other means . Given the range of alternatives available , the treatment of animals can no longer be justified .   In conclusion , humans have built their lives on the backs of animals .

For instance , the influx of tourists results in large demand in restaurant workers , tour guides , hotel staff and employees of retail services , exhorting business owners to hire more people for these positions .   In conclusion , I believe that the advantages of tourism , especially in terms of increased GDP and employment rate , are greater than the drawbacks , namely destruction impact on many destinations and the environment as well as higher crime rate .",7.5,7.5,7.5,7.5

This essay will demonstrate how tourism can transform the economy of poor areas , but will also show that this can lead to such problems as the displacement of local people . Whilst acknowledging that there are drawbacks , the essay will argue that the advantages of the tourist industry outweigh the disadvantages .   @CARDINAL country that has experienced a significant economic boost from tourism is @GPE . Over @DATE @DATE @DATE @DATE , many of its small fishing villages , where people often struggled to make a living , have been developed into thriving holiday destinations . With all the hotels , restaurants , shops and other tourist facilities that have been developed , there are now enough jobs for everyone and the general standard of living has greatly increased . Many local people have spotted new business opportunities and become entrepreneurs which has further diversified the economy .   In @GPE , on the other hand , the huge popularity of the beautiful canals and stunning architecture with visitors from around the world has had a negative impact on local residents . The growing need for tourist accommodation , places to eat and shops have forced many people from their homes to make way for this new development . Not only have these people suffered by having to move away from their family and friends , but the situation has also resulted in a lost sense of community in the worst affected areas .   In conclusion , although mass tourism can sometimes result in local residents having to be relocated , it greatly improves the lives of most people as well as contributing significantly to the national economy .

In my opinion , tourism has many benefits like economic development of the country compared to any disadvantages it might bring .   Despite the drawbacks mentioned below , tourism has many benefits like the economic development of a country . When the foreigners from several different countries visit a place , they bring revenue with them . It provides local people with a lot of job opportunities like the tour guides , hotel business flourishes with booking of extra number of rooms and the earning of restaurants quadruples as the tourists take an interest in local cuisines . In addition , it helps to spread the culture and traditions of a country internationally . This may help in a number of ways to improve the international image of a country . For example , ever since , @GPE has opened its door for international tourism , image of the state has changed into peace loving and noble country . This is of crucial importance in the era when a fierce neighbour is trying to tarnish the image of our country in international politics , hence , tourism is the solutions to send a soft image to the world .   Admittedly , there are a few drawbacks of tourism related to the places which have a maximum influx of traveller during @DATE @DATE @DATE . For example , the northern areas of @GPE receive maximum tourists in @DATE , in other seasons the areas become inaccessible . The local people may lose interest in agriculture and farming as it requires more energy compared to working as a tour guide so it may lead to decrease in crop production . Moreover , the towns and cities may become overcrowded with tourist , especially during vacations and may interfere with @DATE activities of local people .

Regrettably , problems can arise from mismanaged tourism . Asides the fact that not all tourists are credible , some of them end up staying back and therefore , causing an increase in population . However , tourism enriches the nation by bringing development which attracts foreign investors .   Tourism can have a negative effect on a country , in the sense that some of the visitors might have criminal tendencies .

Some think that it is happening due to spending few time of parents with their children and they are engage with their own job . I agree with this statement because the parents are busy with building own career and they are most likely to support their family financially .   Everyone wants to create his own background without depending anyone . The major means of creating base is earning money and @DATE 's generation is tend to do so . So , everybody want to study more and more so that they can figure out an easy way to find job for supporting themselves financially . Sometimes mothers do not leave their job after giving birth of a child . Thus , child do not get enough cear of its mother and grow up with loneliness . When this child become younger , he or she tend to do anything as they want , it might good or bad for society , and bad behaviour causes problem in society .   In other words , having job holder parents of a child get less guidance of parents , who work all day long in an institution , not get that much time to give their child . The parents sometimes ignore their child because of less time . For example , in my neighbourhood , some mothers and fathers both do job and stay minor proportion of their time in their home and with their children . Logically , their children get less guidance and get out from home to make noise and shouting in our roads which disturb the surrounding people . Some people also complained about this to those parents in spite of not getting any response . As a result of this , whole society is concerne about children and forcing them to leave the society .

There is a controversial discussion among people that many social problems committed by teenagers are mostly blamed to parents ' inadequant accompany . For my perspective , I strongly disagree with it , and I reckon social media and school have more essential impacts on this phenomenon .   To begin with , contents published on social media are not likely all optimistic for adolescents . It is commonly known that internet users have the right to speak free online to express their perosonal opinions . Since this case , questionable contents such as violence and pornography are easily imitated by teenagers due to immature value system . With that being said , parents are unlikely to prohibit teenagers ' usage of social media in order to prevent imitation .   In addition , school plays an undeniable role in youths ' social problems as most of them spend a large amount of time in school during @DATE @DATE . Without a doubt , teachers in school should not only impart textbook knowledge , but also teach correct behaviours . For example , young students have higher change to learn poor behaviours such as bully during school if teachers do not correct them immediately . Parents , in this case , are unaware of nothing if no one acknowledge them .   To sum up , I would certainly object the concept that parents are the main reason for teenagers ' delinquency . As far as I am concerned , social media and schools should be more responsible for this phenomenon due to negative impacts from social media and late behaviour correction from schools .",6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0

Do you agree or disagree? ,"Nowadays , there is an increasing number of negative social news related to teenagers , which makes many people attribute the problem to the parents ' lack of concern for their children . From my perspective , while parents are indeed obliged to spend more time with their children , schools and the government also play important roles in dealing with the issue .   It is undeniable that a child 's growing up is inseparable from the parents ' care and cultivation . Scientific research has proved that the absence of motherly and fatherly love would subject a kid to a high risk of psychological trauma , thus obstructing him or her from growing to be a mentally healthy person that gets along well with others . Meanwhile , without the necessary supervision and guide from parents , young people would be easily attracted by the representations of violence and crimes on mass media . It follows that they may be motivated to practice violence in the real life and destabilize local community .   In spite of the significance of parenting and family education , one should not ignore the influence of schools , the government , and the entire society on children 's personal development . It is in the school that teenagers spend most of their time and establish their knowledge system as well as values and morality . Thus , in addition to focusing on the students ' academic performance , schools also need to pay more attention to their psychological wellbeing and guide them to think and behave properly . More importantly , the government should offer financial and institutional support to schools and families , such as increasing educational funding and releasing parents ' pressure of raising children . Also , the government is expected to strengthen the censorship of films , TV shows , and the internet , thereby preventing children from exposure to explicitly violent contents .   In conclusion , teenagers ' crimes and misconducts have a lot to do with the problems of their family and parents . Nonetheless , only through the efforts of schools , the government , and the whole society can those problems be effectively solved .",6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0

Do you agree or disagree? ,"It is an inevitable fact that social problems related to teenagers are a popular , indisputable and debatable issue in this contemporary world . Who is responsible for these social problems ? Is it the teenagers , parents or teachers ? Well , I am inclined to agree with the statement that parents play a vital role in every individual 's life . I would like to propound and expound on this topic to get to a concrete decision .   @ORDINAL , many teenagers lack of social awareness does huge harm to environment by throwing the trash in nearby public areas , spitting and polluting the lanes with their ' No pollution control ' vehicles . However , teachers and parents can educate them the effects of the environment . Furthermore , young adolescents talking some abusive and showing violent behaviour should be banned among schools and at homes and should be strictly punished , so that this will not be repeated next time . For instance- I saw an article in the newspaper regarding the young boy talking nonsense and using abusive language to an old man in public transport . Apparently , parents must control and educate the children in a viable way to respect elders and to make them learn what is good and what is bad from @DATE @DATE @DATE .   @ORDINAL , there has been appalling , indisputable facts recorded in recent times that school students are ragging their juniors and misbehaving with other students . In addition , independence and lenience have been given by the school authorities because of parents force which made students to misbehave . There is a saying that , having anything more than enough is not a good thing . Although many people think its parents responsibility to take care of their children , some people think its the technology and generation gap which plays a paramount role in changing children 's lifestyle . For instance- parents can control the use of mobile phones and regular follow up with the school management can change the behaviour with good guidance .   To conclude , I am inclined to agree with the aforementioned statement that parents play a crucial role in any child 's life , if they do n't take good care and sparing some time from their busy work schedules , children are more likely to get into social problems unaware of what will happen to their future . Therefore , it 's just not only parent 's responsibility , but also teachers and the community surrounding them with good guidance making every individual as a good citizen of the country .",8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0

Some children are able to talk about them to their friends , teachers or relatives and get adequate support .

","It is true that in modern life a great number of people consider that the wealth may consist of the customer 's financial circumstances and their level in society .

I totally assert this point of view and in the essay the relative examples will be outlined , before some ideas are drawn .

Personally , I am strongly convinced with this view . In my opinion , many people around the world now associate wealth with social prestige .

To begin with , ever since the recent industrial revolution , television and mass media have played a crucial role in shaping our society . Media often portrait wealthy people as a significant role model , their assets and lifestyle are displayed as the symbol of luxury and success . Owning to this , a majority of the world 's population , is now convinced that , a person 's worth in society is now a measure of the owned assets .

I moderately agree with this viewpoint , as I believe a person 's profile can make him powerful , but his inner values can only earn him respect .   An individual 's characteristics such as honour , kindness and trust forms the basis of long term relationships ; not only at present , but also maintains respect after his death . For example , The Mother Teresa ; she is well known not for her material wealth , but for her generosity and the value of human life . The fame and status may seem worthwhile at the moment until one possesses money and or a post . When that is gone , no one will ever remember him . To exemplify , there are many such politicians who once were the face of their region or nation , however nobody remembers them at present .

No matter how well cultured one is , he can merely achieve success in the present world , unless he has some connection with high profile people . That is why , these persons with economic blessings and social status are considered as the very important personalities . They use money and power to achieve everything they desire , even get away with serious crimes . For instance , Nirmala rape case in @GPE , where the case could not move forwards , just because the accused was the son of some powerful politician .

I agree that modern world has a completely different set of criteria for assessing or honouring a member of the society , though they are not the real elements to define a person .   Earlier , societies had some specific indicators to judge a man or woman . Among the judging indicators , they preferred qualities like honesty , kindness , trusts , honour etc . But with the change of time , such pointers have vanished . Unluckily the present society prefers social status or riches to judge anyone . A real - life experience may make it simpler . Recently , I closely observed a local election in a distant part of @GPE . Among the @CARDINAL candidates - one of them came from a high profile background while the other one was a @NORP man who merely had his own permanent living space in the locality . The majority of the people supported the @ORDINAL individual . They took him granted as a gentleman as he is enriched with material possessions . On the contrary , only a few people supported the poor guy . He was unable to spend bucks for the election but was competing on some moral grounds . He dreamt of changing the society . Unluckily he was defeated by the wealthy candidate . The rich man did not allow his opposition to be an obstacle to his success .   This triumph and defeat made me realise that material possessions are the key to judging as important in society . When people have enough riches to spend , they can buy social status and supports . But unfortunately , when someone comes up with humanitarian features , social elites term them as old - fashioned . They are ignored .   Therefore , I think such ideas should be changed . We should appreciate the humane features than social status and material possessions . Otherwise , the consequences will be detrimental . When the social status will be the indicator to judge oneself , I believe that would be too humiliating and may lead to massive social disorder .",5.5,5.5,5.5,5.5

And then there are other celebrities who are well known due to his / her social status as the son or the daughter of a wealthy family . @CARDINAL of the examples would be @ORG @ORG . Although she has many bad attitudes , she is still popular because she inherits the assets of her parents .   Although traditional values such as respect others , being responsible , honesty and integrity seem to be forgotten nowadays , but they still play an important part in many communities . In common cases , employers are still assessing their potential employees based their hard working attitude , positive behaviour and their integrity . And then business people are still looking for business partners who are reliable , can be trusted , and dependable . Therefore , it is important for adults to educate their children about these positive values because they still play an essential part in the societies .   In conclusion , even though people are judged based on their wealth and social status nowadays , but I do believe that old fashioned values such as honour , respect and trust can not be eliminated from our daily lives . Therefore we must teach our young generation about these cultures , in order for them to survive and succeed in the future .",5.5,5.5,5.5,5.5

Old-fashioned values, such as honour, kindness and trust, no longer seem important. 4","More and more people nowadays believe that social status and material possessions are the most important features in @CARDINAL person . However , they are completely wrong .   In our technological world all of us forget what are the real values we should possess . We are thinking that our life is a competition in which we have no real friend who could trust so we behave cold , losing ours kindness .   The real problem though is that losing these values is a tendency by youngsters who are using their smartphones non - stop . Because it is a technology which made the world a material one . These young people would give the exact same example to their children so it would become odd if someone is kind or trusting .   I do not think that we realise the risks of being material . Even though it sounds like a cliche , it is true : Money can not buy you happiness . Yes , you would be pleased if you have a big house with a pool , some modern cars and a huge company but where is your big family ? To be a happy , loved , honoured , kind and loving person does not require material possessions and a particular social status . It requires a big heart .   In the past people were divided into groups by their social status . These on the bottom of the pyramid were living a terrible life because the only thing they possessed were some vital values .   My opinion is that we should not go back in these times . The only change which is necessary is to ensure a good life for everyone - let 's make the world a modern but a pleasant place .",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

","A group of individuals claims that the large of budget might possibly be considered as a tool to evaluate the values of a person rather than their characteristics . In my opinion , I completely disagree with the above notion since there are a number of aspects that people should highly appreciate to judge one 's worth .   There is no doubt that various celebrities might not be paid tribute by others even though they possess a large of real states and cash . The recent studies reported that some of famous people could not be given the forgiveness from fans after serious sandals such as portrayed with lovers or treat others so bad and others . This could intensively reduce the number of followers on social networks and leave others a negative impression on those . As a result , celebrities might be overlooked and judged as a lower educated individual rather than being respectful because of their money .   Moreover , the well behavior and attitude could support people to reach to a new peak among @DATE routines and career . It is undeniable that employees who are more likely to treat kindly and give others the reliability might be appreciated much into the important position in an organization even though their account experienced a low - income in the bank . Since the characteristics of those could offer the satisfaction to partners and managers such as sense of honour and trust , staffs could easily convince others to follow the common vision and lead a team to achieve certain successes . To illustrate , @PERSON gate have been ranked as one of the most influent billionaires by his creation of @ORG word in the whole world . Not only by personal achievements , he also was evaluated as a wise and charming person when funding much money to the charity and voluntary programs in order to help children be developed in a better living environment   In conclusion , I consider that the worth of individuals might be evaluated by different aspects rather than one 's possession .

On the @CARDINAL hand , those who believe that , mobile phones are evil , point out that , this can tarnish both family relationships and friendships .

However , opponents of the above argument think that this abolishes the distances an I firmly support this . This facilitates people to interact with friends and relatives , who , even , live in the other part of the globe .

Before the rise of technology , family values were passed through generations . Now , children have open access to an excruciating amount of information and social media . The internet gives us a false impression that the person 's worth lies on how much money they have and how they portrait their lifestyle online .   A direct effect of capitalism is measuring someone 's worth by the amount of money they have . This culture tells us that it 's more important to accumulate material belongings rather than investing in human connection . If we continue to devote all of our time to work , are we really living ? Although we can not aim to completely change the economic system we live in , we should think of better ways to live a happier and healthier life .   Social media is an amazing tool to bring people together , but it is actually bringing them apart . What is depicted online is n't the reality . One can post a picture of a perfect and wealthy life and be depressed and drowning in debt . To avoid those misconceptions , there has to be conscious use of technology , spend more time outdoors , having meaningful conversations away from your mobile phone . The scarcity of eye contact and human touch can be very damaging to our mental health .   Even though the way we live have dramatically changed over @DATE @DATE , deep down people are still the same . Human beings are wired to seek connection and are unable to live alone . Knowing that , there 's hope that in the future we will learn how to balance every aspect of our life .

Happiness which is directly dependent on materialism does not last long because these needs are never ending . Consequently , these humankind never get a sense of fulfillment , also never grateful for what they already have , this leads to depression and anxiety . For instance , A study published in The @ORG newspaper shows that @PERCENT @PERCENT of famous public - faces go through anti depression treatment at least once in a lifetime . Thus , judgements based on someone 's possessions are often incorrect .   Also for building good business relations , trust is vital and considered important by organisations before signing any deal . Moreover , money can not buy everything , for example a good character or healthy relationships . While choosing friends or a life partner their personality traits are highly significant because no one can stay happy with an arrogant or negative personality . A survey published in a well - known magazine demonstrates that people who are intrigued by money are often depressed and lead an unhappy life .   In conclusion , It is true that our community is getting highly influenced by rich and famous celebrities .

I completely agree with this statement because as mankind has evolved , so does the principles that we carry .

As a result , our original values , that we hold to a certain standard , become blurry because negative influences were entering our nation from every way possible , either technologically or culturally . Furthermore , These developments helped improve the world economy . A lot of countries that were undergoing recession experienced a dramatic upturn in their economies . Thus , the idea that money can buy us happiness was born because having money was a rarity during that time .

I totally agree that ethics and values are very important in one 's life and it shows the environment in which we bought up . In this essay , we will discuss both sides of the coin before any conclusion can be drawn .   @ORDINAL , ethics and values hold great importance in life , both personally and professionally . Nowadays , people are being judged by their social status , instead of their values of life . For example , we @NORP are very religious by nature , but in daily life we forget our values for little gains . Values are those acts we learn in our childhood from our parents and relatives . It means understanding other people 's emotions and respecting their culture and lives . Also , no business and profession can progress without trust , values and ethics . All your degrees and certificates make no sense , if you do not know how to respect other people . Furthermore , good ethics and values depicts your country , culture and heritage . For example , @NORP are famous in international countries for their customs and values , such as how we touch our parent 's feet in the morning etc .   @ORDINAL , some people think that no business and profession is possible @DATE @DATE , while maintaining old values and traditions . Young generation has failed miserably in preserving those old values . Some of the old traditions have gone obsolete and inappropriate in @DATE 's world and a new set of traditions should be created instead . Our education system plays an important role in a child 's development and values should be taught to them in early stages .

It gives us an image that , human beings are assessed based on their riches and their prominence , rather than based on their essential values such as honesty and kindness as these seem to be far less necessary . I certainly agree with this perception wherein whopping finances determine the status of an individual . However , I have some hesitations in completely accepting it . This essay will discuss in detail about my opinion , which is slightly inclined towards the former .   On the @CARDINAL hand , human life is reduced to making money surreptitiously . Most of us dislike to acknowledge this phenomenon . Furthermore , the one who earns more , enjoys a monopoly over his business and so he is put on limelight for his repeated success over his rivals . He is considered as an inspiration for the rest of the youths to follow . His finances grow multi - fold with his name being spelled across all the global capitals . For example , @PERSON @PERSON became prominent ever since his company @ORG ruled the entire planet with virtual workspaces . His profits are more than that of the entire people 's finances on the planet . Therefore , we tend to get attracted by such soft power rather looking at ingrained values .   On the other hand , there are several people who stick to their noble values such as kindness , honesty and integrity . For example , a company in @LOC @LOC had invented a way of converting plastic to combustible fuel in a legitimate way . However , their invention was arraigned and their ideas were stolen by people who want to make huge profits by selling the existing crude oil . Their intention was to maximise their profits by blocking the integral ideas and values . Therefore , honesty and kindness are considered as mostly dead . Thanks to the respiring judiciary , which gives us a bleak hope that these integral values are still appreciated .   To recapitulate , making skyrocketing profits or achieving stardom is a luxury which not all can replicate . We need to appreciate the way they made a success and imbibe it to our life , if it aligns with our moral values .

Although , most of the managers have no idea what the situation is about , still they chair the large meetings by copying the work of their subordinates .

Therefore , I disagree with the above statement very strongly and this essay will explain why .   No matter how far we all go in terms of tech and modernization , every human instinctively respects these values . What happens to the filthy rich couple , when one of them cheats ? The money and status do not help . And , if the other one decides not to forgive the infidelity , they end up making the biggest decision of their lives .

In my personal opinion , I think when it comes to @ORDINAL impressions , we do judge a person 's worth by their material possessions and social status .

As said by @PERSON ' only survival of the fittest ' and each individual has taken it to their heart . I personally disagree with the fact of judging a person solely based on their social status and possessions , because in the long run its not wealth or material things that matter , instead a person has to be charismatic and honest . I had seen a person who had all the wealth he dreamt of , but by nature he is wicked and cunning . Obviously for the short period he was admired and treated well by the society but due to an unexpected crisis he lost all his wealth and possessions , he was shown with with harsh reality of being lonely and no one even bothered to care about him . He lead rest of his life in misery and ended up in jail for commiting hinaous crime .

Each item of news is classified more carefully and thoroughly in printed newspapers than those on the Internet due to the money they cost . @ORDINAL , reading the papers can remain a healthy way for readers to gain information .

"Although more and more people read news on the internet, newspapers will remain the most important source of news. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? 8","In the present situation where many people read news online , it has been a debatable issue whether newspapers will survive as the most essential source of news or not . I totally disagree with the opinion because traditional newspapers lead to a waste of the woods and people do not trust them because of its corruption .   The main reason why I believe that newspapers will be useless is that publishing daily newspapers is wasting valuable forests . The environmental issue is increasingly serious nowadays ; for example , the deforestation of vast rain forests in the @ORG , which can convert CO2 to oxygen , so they have contributed to global warming by converting less CO2 back to oxygen , has led to the increase of carbon dioxide emission , and it also led to a rise of sea level , and the drought in @LOC @LOC . Therefore , many people have started to perceive the importance of preserving the earth in a clean and safe state , and besides look for alternatives for the printed media .   Another reason why I support the notion that newspapers will disappear is that they have been used as an effective tool by people with power and money throughout history . In particular , from @EVENT , when the @NORP controlled @NORP citizens with their detrimental propaganda , to the most recent case , when @NORP authorities hid the actual number of @PERSON cases spreading around , the conventional media , especially newspapers , has been manipulated by governments . Consequently , people prefer to depend on SNS or the Internet , such as @PRODUCT and @ORG in @DATE @DATE .   In conclusion , I contend that the printed media will lose its influence in the future because the environmental issue is a worldwide trend and people are unlikely to believe newspapers due to their corruption . Given this situation , it seems that people should have a keen sight to differentiate true from false when they get new information from any source .",8.5,8.5,8.5,8.5

While some people think that traditional press will remain the most important source of news , I believe electronic articles and print newspapers will progress together to bring abundant news to the public .   On the one hand , I accept that traditional newspapers will not go out of business regardless of the burgeoning trend of online news reading . @ORDINAL , many publications has always acted as the face of certain organisations throughout its long history , and the ritual of enjoying a daily newspaper with a cup of coffee in the morning has been instilled in many generations . @ORDINAL , unlike digital media , people do not need to get online to read breaking news of their choice , and this is really a plus point in many ways . Take inhabitants in rural areas , where Internet is not something ubiquitous compared with urban areas , as an example - they remain happy to catch up with the latest news at local newsstands .   However , with more and more people from a wide variety of ages reading online news everyday , I believe media on the Internet has massive advantages to compete with traditional newspapers . The main benefit is its flexibility ; correspondents deliver every piece of news @CARDINAL and anyone in the world can read the hottest headlines as long as they manage to get online . It is also difficult to refuse visual attraction of illustration from high quality images , sound effects and colourful animation attached with the central news . Another benefit of online news is its responsive capabilities which is supported by many social platforms such as @ORG @ORG @ORG @ORG @ORG , et cetera . It means that after reading an appealing article , a news reader could see comments from other @ORG or share his or her own opinion to the online community .   In conclusion , digital media on the Internet is increasingly becoming an essential source of the latest news for a large number of readers and I believe this electronic type of media will play as important a role as print newspapers have been thus far .",6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0

Another reason could be that the accuracy of the information published in the journal . The newspaper has well known journalists who share news which would be closer to reality . As newspapers tend to be a quite sensitive journal , the news getting printed on them are closely monitored , in order to avoid hurting the sentiments of people . However , as the internet is vast , so the news online can not be monitored or censored , this encourages a number of wrong and incorrect information being circulated , a reason for fewer people relying on it .

While some people agree with the above opinion , I personally contend that conventional newspapers will disappear in @DATE @DATE with the following @CARDINAL rationales .   To begin with , the development of technology has accelerated the process of transmitting information between providers and consumers . For instance , nowadays , it is almost impossible not to witness people with no mobile devices , such as smartphones , tablets , and @PERSON . While we could only use the rudimentary type of cell phones in @DATE @DATE @DATE .

Everybody is able to become a reporter or a viewer , and I believe that is a revolutionary alteration .   Another reason I find the upheaval more reasonable is that conventional newspapers have been manipulated . To be specific , from WW2 , when @NORP spread their malicious , detrimental and manipulative propagandas , to the recent cases , when @GPE regime is controlling official broadcasts to hide the truth of an enormous amount of nuclear emission in @GPE . The prime minister , @PERSON , mentioned ' everything is under control , ' , and the official , private broadcasts have never questioned regarding the issue against the government . Likewise , traditional news is likely to be used as a powerful tool for people who have money and authority ; therefore , people have been finding a better way to replace outdated means .   In conclusion , while some people believe that conventional news will continue in the future , I am convinced that newspapers and broadcasts will be disappeared in @DATE @DATE because the power of technology is strong enough to address the corruption across worldwide media .",8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0

For example , in @GPE , many newspaper publishers have stopped publishing newspapers as their business went down because of advanced technology .

There is a widespread notion that the proliferation of supermarkets will wipe out local communities . However , the reality is that supermarkets can help revitalize the local community . To illustrate , the town where I live always wore a deserted look . This all changed after the inauguration of well - known supermarket chain in my locality . The entire area transformed into a bustling town .   Moreover , supermarkets serve local communities by offering them a range of products at competitive prices . Since supermarkets are bulk buyers , which means that they enjoy economy of scale and are in the position to offer unlimited and diverse products at a cheaper price to their customers . For instance , a member of the local community can find an imported product in a supermarket which might not be available at a local shop which not only gives more choice and freedom to the consumer , but also raises their standard of living manifold .   Furthermore , supermarkets play an active role in the community by creating jobs .

This growth along with rising incomes in developing countries may cause dietary changes such as consumption of more protein and meat . As a consequence , this may lead to driving up more worldwide food demand . Furthermore , the rise in temperature due to climate change will have severe long - term effects on the crop fields . For example , a recent research exhibits that countries which are located near the equator , will face a huge reduction in crop output because of alterations in weather and temperature . Hence , increasing number of citizens and changing climatic conditions are the main causes of growing necessity of sustenance in numerous countries around the world .   The be - all and end - all solution to this problem is to increase the amount of agricultural land for growing grains . @ORG should allocate more areas to cultivate plants , fruits and vegetables rectify this issue . Moreover , farmers should enhance the productivity by using irrigation methods and latest techniques , such as precision farming . Therefore , the most viable solution to this issue of meeting global food demand can be achieved by either using large area for cultivating crops or improving the farming strategies in the existing land .   In conclusion , population increase and climate change are directly proportional to the high demandd of sustenance . It is recommended that governments should provide more land to the agriculturalists and educate them about the latest technologies which are useful in agriculture",8.5,8.5,8.5,8.5

This essay will discuss both sides and give my own opinion .   There are several positive aspects to teaching children / students in mixed schools . @CARDINAL of them is that boys and girls learn about how to respect each other . These schools help them to understand that both genders have equal rights and positions in society . For example , mixed education systems conduct a lot of extra - curricular activities to prove that boys and girls have the same potential to accomplish tasks . Another reason is that co - ed schools educate boys and girls to work in diversification . These schools educate how to understand a different gender in terms of biological factors , emotions and behaviors . Overall , mixed schools allow boys and girls to understand and respect each other in a society .   On the other hand , same sex schools have their own merits . These schools can spend time in educating one gender with more focus and can also teach students with new methodologies based on the gender . For instance , a research from @ORG @ORG shows that girls perform better in mathematics if they get lessons through real- life situations . Another benefit is that teachers do not hesitate to discuss the gender specific topic while teaching . To illustrate , I remember that reproduction cycle chapter from @DATE @DATE @DATE . My biology instructor had to take a separate class for boys as she was embarrassed to discuss the topic in the class of mixed students . Therefore , same sex schools open a channel for teachers to widen their teaching skills and give liberty to discuss the study materials .

","In @DATE @DATE , the question of whether or not it is more beneficial to send students to single - sex schools has received a great deal of public attention . Although this choice appears attractive , the disadvantages will be far more significant .   On the one hand , there are a number of reasons why some think that students should study in single - gender schools . @ORDINAL , since boys and girls have different learning needs , it is better for them to be taught separately . In fact , single - sex schools offer teaching styles , subject choices and learning programmes that are entirely focused on either boys or girls , which would help each individual pursue their strengths and passions . @ORDINAL , by enrolling in the same - sex schools , students will have less chance for early relationships . Without worrying about these distractions , they might be able to concentrate more on their studies , and therefore , might get higher academic results than those at co - ed schools .   On the other hand , I would argue that it would be better for students to enter mixed - gender education . @ORDINAL , in order to raise students ' gender awareness , it is really necessary to teach them in co - ed schools . For example , male and female students are given the chance to explore each other 's perspective , their similarities and differences , which leads to better knowledge about co - existence and gender equality in students . @ORDINAL , if students participate in mixed - classes , they will have the opportunity to interact and take part in group work activities with opposite - sex classmates . This may help them learn a wide range of skills such as communication or teamwork which are necessary for their later jobs .

Taking an education in different schools become beneficial for some children in some cases attraction between both genders convert into relationships which affects their study as well as it may force them to suffer , consequently , they may lose their precious time of getting knowledge . Moreover , comfortable at school and in classroom with same gender could be productive for those who feels shy , they can show their talent and find their hidden skills which can immensely handy in their education as well as in social life . For example , it is observed by researchers , in single gender schools , learners ask questions frequently to teachers even to classmates   On the other hand , co - sex schools have their different status , in these training academies , children learn the manners of cuommunication , respect and the importance of equality even though the do n't feel shy to raise their voice and asking about something to their mentors as a result of this they understand each other and behaviours . Furthermore , this is a fact of real life if the opposite sex tries to surpass then people do hard work , so competition in classrooms between genders give impetus to achieve higher marks which become beneficial in further studies and they can find interest in education . Probing further , it is seen in single gender institute especially in boys ' classrooms , they use vulgar languages , even some become haughty , as learning in the same school they keep away from sleazy words . For instance , a group discussion helps to enhance the knowledge better understanding and share the views , they find freedom to talk each other frequently , consequently they come over the fear of shyness .

This happen due to some reasons but personally , I am in greater favor of the belief that cycling should be encouraged rather than driving cars .   The greater prevalence of car driving than pedaling in some cities can be attributed to a couple of reasons . @ORDINAL , with regard to time efficiency , cars prove superior to bikes . This makes sense , especially when individuals need to travel long distances in the shortest time . However , if people opted for bicycles in the same situations , it would take them double or triple amount of time travelling to reach the destination , which is undoubtedly inconvenient for users . @ORDINAL , cars bring people a sense of safety and security . For instance , car users are more likely to avoid intentional robberies or unexpected weather conditions such as lightning and whirlwind which may be life - threatening .   Despite the benefits of car driving , cycling has still gained popularity in some cities , and my explanation for this is twofold . The @ORDINAL reason is that this means of transport bestows a positive impact on the environment . Unlike cars emitting exhaust fumes to worsen air quality , bikes are absolutely nature - friendly dur to no burning of fuels such as oil and gas . Another reason is that cycling is a popular choice to prevent some fatal diseases . Scientific studies have shown that riding bikes on a regular basis can lower the risk of cancers and heart attacks . Therefore , it is well - advised for individuals to travel by biked on a more regular basis .   In summary , each means of transportation has its unique advantages .

On the @CARDINAL hand , boys and girls could learn to interact with each other in joint schools .

In @CARDINAL camp , it is believed that educating boys and girls in a co - education system reaps numerous bounties .

When looking at this side of the debate , the benefits that are derived from separate schools for girls and boys can be seen .   Although both sides of this argument have indisputable virtues , it is felt that practice of educating male and female pupils in the same school is much more of a positive development than negative .

I will discuss both sides and will give my opinion .

However , studying in single - gender - institutions can reduce the rate of these figures . As a prime example , @CARDINAL of sexual assaults are reported in the U.

For instance , @NORP @NORP citizens prefer their children to study in a single sex school , whereas the administration admits both genders in @CARDINAL educational place .   On the other hand , I personally give a green light to those supporting co - educational system . The @ORDINAL reason behind it is that this system definitely would be less costly . Clearly , to divide girls and boys , governments have to spend more money on education because they can not use empty spaces of a female school for a male one , or vice versa . As a result , less educational facilities should be provided for scholars , declining the total education budget . Furthermore , this method can improve students ' communication skills . Obviously , having a better relationship with the opposite sex , juveniles will have a closer relationship not only during their study but during their matrimonial life . They generally have fewer marriage problems with their partner due to having a better experience before . In this way , @PERSON @PERSON , a very familiar former psychologist , believe that humans ' social skills are fundamentally developed as they have closer feelings to their opposite sex during childhood .

To illustrate , @ORG girls college in @LOC state always record the overall best @ORG result in that state and their principal , when interviewed , attributed their success to their same - sex pattern .   On the other hand , it is my opinion that lecturing students in a joint - sex school improves their self confidence and social interaction . This is due to the fact that , scholars from such schools are accustomed to relating with one another which automatically make them free and confident when in public places . In addition , making friends from both gender when in unfamiliar places would not be difficult as they are well experienced in such aspect due to constant interaction , hence , their social skills are improved . For instance , a personal project research showed that @PERCENT @PERCENT @PERCENT of female party poopers attended colleges of same - sex . This goes to show why a joint - gender academy increases social interaction .   In conclusion , although tutoring scholars in identical - gender colleges boost their level of focus and class achievement , i believe that fused - sex colleges are preferable as they increase their self- reliant and socialization skills .",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

On the @CARDINAL hand , some people oppose the mixed school education as according to them this leads to the distraction of students from their studies and hindrance in their career growth . The crucial reason for this is that while boys and girls studying together , they generally get attracted toward opposite gender and indulge in close friendships , which often takes their mind away from academics . As a consequence , their academic grades lower down and they get diverted from the original goals of their life . Therefore , considering the numerous cases of young students running away from homes due to indulgence in love affairs , this education system is not supported .   On the other hand , those who believe that co - education is beneficial for the students assert that this way of learning makes the students rational thinkers and educate them to respect the person of opposite gender . This is because when girls and boys study at same platform they often share the workload , eat and play together , and develops a bond of friendship which certainly abolishes the shyness among them and , moreover , boost their level of confidence .

For example , boys are more talented in cricket more than girls because they usually watch all the cricket matches therefore boys can teach to the girls about how to achieve high marks in cricket and what are the tips to win the game .

This essay will debate each standpoint , before presenting my own perspective .   It is evident that mixed - gender schools may offer much insight into the human psyche of both sexes , thus ensuring students are well - equipped for real - world encounters . Such institutions provide pupils with a diverse student body hence a comprehensive array of viewpoints . This allows for in - depth perception of the other sex and the eradication of certain gender clichés . In consequence , co - education may vastly aid communication and engagement in future career - wise affairs . Nonetheless , the occurrence of another gender may more or less be a nuisance for students , exerting impact on their concentration . Opposite sexes are often regarded as a prospective diversion from studies . Due to specific physical characteristics of school students , some are susceptible to distraction owing to personal sentiments , whilst others may even feel intimidated by the other gender . Such a phenomenon is prevalent in plenty of institutions , rendering distress for parents and school authorities .   As regards the gender - isolated approach , it is often esteemed for its efficiency in scholastic matters . In view of gender distinctions , single - sex institutions are capable of offering a made - to - measure curriculum , devised for a specific body of students . As a result , this allows pupils to engross in a tailor - made program , thus augmenting individual and general exam results . On this account , single - sex education may immensely profit students in their course of study . Nevertheless , such a method may also give rise to particular communication issues . Students who frequently associate with solely males or females tend to be ill - prepared for interactions with the opposite gender . As a consequence , such individuals may deem contact with the other sex as immensely difficult , thus hindering day - to - @DATE cooperation . With such social drawbacks , it may seem nonviable for students to coexist in a diverse organisation .

Moreover , a male can sit beside a female on the same bench without any hesitation .   On the other hand , the mixed schools have more advantages than the others . Some of these are , the pupils will communicate with the other gender on a @DATE basis , which gives them an advantage to understand the others and increase their communication and negotiation skills . Furthermore , these skills are very important , not only during the higher education , but also during their work and how to choose their partner . For instance , if a boy decides to engage a girl he has to understand her needs to be a successful relationship . So , the question is , how can we split the @CARDINAL genders and God create them to live together ?   To summarize , there are different ways of thinking which will affect the personality of the children . There is no doubt that parents need their children to be well educated , but they have to influence positively on their type of personality as it will continue life time .",8.5,8.5,8.5,8.5
