What problems will your country face in the next ten years?


How can these problems be overcome?


Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In the modern era of globalization, numerous countries are facing crucial challenges in different aspects, such as environmental, teaching and population issues. It is an inescapable condition in large and high populations concerned with its effects. The following paragraphs will examine the problem of these challenges and recommend some practical solutions.

To begin with, there are numerous problems in Thailand in the next decade. Initially, older society will be a huge issue in the next ten years because the younger generation is getting less revenue, while higher expenses are caused by the recession economy. Furthermore, this is the main factor that the new generation has no idea about having a child. Secondly, inequality in learning is one of the most pressing issues now and might continue to 2032, because it has profoundly affected children in the present. To illustrate, if some offspring cannot access learning materials they would be affected less knowledge in the foreseeable future.

To tackle this problem, there are several methods that the ministry could do. Firstly, the state government should provide levy less taxation for convincing them to have a kid. Moreover, the authorities should encourage or afford welfare families by getting additional fees monthly. Secondly, the state official should provide equal literacy in way of free tuition in order to contribute to equal opportunities. Additionally, politics should educate parents on how schooling plays an essential role.

In conclusion, these problems will not able to occur if the government takes seriously actions or responsibilities. Thus, as a human on this planet we should try to display and express how these issues are strongly criteria in an aspect.",7
1,"There have been major advances in technology over the recent decades and this has lead to significant improvement in people’s lives.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There has been a noticeable change in People’s lives as a result of massive improvement in automation. I completely agree with this statement as will be further explained in this essay. 

Admittedly, there are some basic drawbacks associated with the use of machinery. One of such is the increase in the rate of crime in society. Youngsters learn how to commit social media fraud as they are exposed to diverse videos on the internet. This makes them acquire knowledge that impacts negatively on  society. For example, my neighbour's son was arrested for cybercrime. When he was interrogated, he confessed that he learnt the skill from cyberspace and he has been using the skill to defraud people of their hard-earned money. So, automation increases the crime rate.

Nevertheless, despite the above minor demerit associated with the use of technology, I believe the use of machinery has brought a lot of positive changes. Automation has improved the way individuals learn. In other words, it has made learning easier and faster. That is, individuals can easily surf the internet for information and spend less time gathering data, which will ultimately reduce stress and fatigue. For instance, my sister finished her project work before her coursemates because she utilized the internet and she got a distinction in her exams. Therefore, technology has brought tremendous changes in people’s lives and should be encouraged.

In conclusion, I am in complete agreement with the fact that machinery has positively impacted our lives. Thus, efforts should be made by the relevant authorities to encourage its usage.",9
2,Tourism is encouraged in many countries. Does tourism bring more advantages or disadvantages to a country?,"Many countries around the world enjoy and encourage tourism and travelling visitors. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages that tourism can bring to a country.

Quite clearly, one of the biggest benefits of global and local tourism is the huge boost to economies that this can bring. Many people know that when they travel they will quite often spend a lot of money - sometimes in local shops or businesses. For example, as people visit new locations, they will purchase goods and souvenirs of this place, as well as use local facilities such as transport or restaurants. Furthermore, a great advantage of people visiting countries or cities they have never been to can be that they develop their understanding of a new place and foreign culture. This led to a better knowledge of how people around the world live their  lifestyles. For instance, by knowing different languages, we can all come to respect each other much more.

On the other hand, one of the biggest disadvantages of tourism can be reliance on this as a source of income. If an area relies heavily on tourists spending money there, but tourists do stop visiting, then this can be devastating for the local economy. Covid-19 has meant that global tourism has crashed, leaving many countries that need tourists for income in a dire financial situation. As well as this, globetrotting can also mean a huge increase in environmental pollution and problems. Many people need to travel by air and as we know planes  are a huge contributor to carbon emissions which lead to global warming. In addition to this, as tourists travel to a location, they may cause pollution through littering or not caring for the local environment as the local population might.

In conclusion, we can clearly see that there are many advantages and disadvantages when considering the effects of tourism.",8.5
3,"Nowadays, many families move overseas for job opportunities. Some people think that this is beneficial for the children of these families, while others think that children will find it difficult. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","It is undeniable that many households are migrating to foreign countries to have a good work-life balance. Consequently, it has been debatable that some people accept this is good for children's life, however, others think that it makes children  have difficulties. In my opinion, I believe that children can get benefits because  their families are moving  abroad.

On the one hand, there are people who take the view that the children will get difficulties because their families move  overseas. The most convincing reason for believing this is that children need to struggle to adapt to new places without having their playmates . A particularly good example here is that children will not be happy if they go to school as they don’t have friends and they might have language barriers in making new friends if their first language is not the same as the migrated country’s language. Moreover, they will have difficulties getting new neighbouring friends to play with after school.

Despite  the above arguments, I am of the view that this makes more improve children’s lives rather than making difficulties. The main reason for believing this is that they can learn valuable education in abord country that they move. For instance, most  families used to migrate to a developed country such as the USA for their children to get a better education. In addition, the children are able to learn different kinds of subjects that they want to learn in those countries. A further reason I hold to this view is that children are able to get a better life and they can improve their living standard when they grow up. 

To sum up, although both arguments have their own merits, I believe moving  overseas is a good way to get a better education for the children and have a work-life balance for parents.",8.5
4,"Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their
free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is believed by some locals that voluntary work can be an advantageous option for teenagers and start serving their community could be an option. Personally speaking, I agree with the statement because in a community people have to work together if they want to live in a high living standard. 

Working for their own community, teenagers could broaden their social skills and become aware of their role in a society. During that time, those people could get along with some senior locals and exchange experiences, for example. It is also the perfect way to start developing working skills when  delivering the mail, walking pets for their neighbors/the elders, cleaning pools, to start with. These are some services that an unexperienced teenager could get involved. In community service, teenagers do not have to have previous experience and it is not a demanding job which teenagers could easily learn from and understand the value of working. 

If, from one side, one can number lots of benefits, on the other hand/side, some people can have bias against those kinds of jobs because they give the false impression that those who are serving the community are required to do so because they might have done something wrong or harmful to others, since these kinds of services are currently being used as punishment. Working for a community should not be a punishment in any circumstances. 

In conclusion, we can see that motivating a teenager to do voluntary work is a posivite win-win attitude and, as result of this kind of job, community leaders could invest their effords in other important needs such as providing better heath and education structure in a feedback wheel.",5
5,"In some countries, people encourage students to find part-time jobs while some people don't. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","In the contemporary epoch,there is irrefutable debate among folks  about part-time jobs for graduates.In certain countries,individuals inspire learners to find part-time employment while others do not advocate for it. I firmly coincide with and withstand the stated notion that it will expose the student in the line of the employment environment.This discourse will further elucidate my assertion in the forthcoming paragraph.

Firstly,this kind of exposure is very advantagious to the young stars although the society is not really for it.They end up practising what they are taught in lecture rooms as a results the gain experience and get exposure particularly in their area of interest.Moreover,work experience can help them land their dream job because most recruiters prefer to employ individuals with some experience.For example,a research done by kepsa(2020) depicts that 90% of employer prefer to give a job to people who have gone for an internship which help them as they do not take long to adapt to the system.Consequently,it is imperative for school-going people to undertake part-time attachment.

On the other hand,this can be detrimental since it can bring some disruption in the study although the student understands and retain more when they practice what they are taught in the classroom.Furthermore ,the scholar is not in a position to prepare for exams or even attend group discussion with others as there are duties allocated to them by the employer.For example,a research done by  the University of Nairobi depicts that part-time jobs for finalists make them drop out of school.Therefore,a certain individual does not advise pupils to work as it affects their performance as well as some end up dropping out of the academy

To sum up,i would like to restate the perspective that i concur that undergraduates must take part-time jobs to gain relevant experience for the sake of future dream jobs despite others advocating that it will affect the graduate end results.",6
6,"The first man to walk on the moon claimed it was a step forward for mankind. However, it has made little difference in most people’s lives.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is no shortage of opinions on whether it was necessary or not to spend a huge number of resources in the last century on space travel. But if I were forced to choose, I would definitely say that the landing on the moon was truly a great leap for mankind. It is my firm belief that for a number of reasons and I will develop these ideas in the subsequent paragraphs. 

First of all, the vast majority of nowadays inventions actually went from a military industry. The space race between the Soviet Union and the US combined all the greatest engineers and scientists to reach the goal of building the best rockets and spacecrafts. Therefore, it led to devising new technologies like power microchips, personal computers, protected networks etc. As a result, after the ending of the space race, a bigger part of inventions came to the public and it caused a sharp rise of electronics in the following years. For instance, computers and the Internet are just a few examples of things we use since that time. It is certainly clear to see why cosmic programs have a positive impact, as today we cannot even imagine how to exist without laptops and social networks.

Secondly, people were always curious about stars and objects which they can easily see at midnight. There are a lot of books and stories being written about space topics, especially about the colonization of other planets or the invasion of aliens to our Earth. And the thing is even our generation does not leave hopes for space travelling. For example, Elon Musk with his company Space X promised to send rockets to Mars and his test flights have already succeeded, so we might see the launch in the near future. For this reason, I think that Nil Armstrong's statement about the great step forward for mankind was on point.

To sum up, in light of the above-mentioned reasons, I want to emphasize that people always were eager to discover more about other worlds and life behind the Earth, therefore the first expedition to the moon made a difference for what we have now.",7

8,"In some cultures, children are often told that they can achieve anything if they try hard enough.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving children this message?","It is widely believed that  teaching children to be more  diligent by working hard is an effective way to make them attain their achievements .While there are numerous benefits to the children’s mindset and skill development during the process, its drawbacks should be taken into account to prevent the negative consequences that may arise.

            To begin with , there are numerous examples of famous people's stories that affirm the value of endeavour. One of the most common histories always told to  children is the story of famous millionaires who begin their working life without prosperous background.This means that they should  be  more patient to build up their businesses before reaching a successful period.Many children may be inspired by these stories and be more focused directly on their life goals.Therefore,they should be more disciplined and do their best  in their present duty.Such behaviours lead to the formation of permanent good habits.Moreover, these children may develop crucial skills during working hard such as reading comprehension skills,vocational skills ,and working skills.These phenomena are beneficial to their future careers. Therefore,children may  alter their life to be more  positive ways by using the concept of perseverance.

            However,some children may suffer from stress that results from working harder.This may be the outcome of  premature  confront with the challenges.Children should be naturally  nurtured with  moderate expectations,so forcing them to be more  patient to succeed in every aspect should be harmful. For instance, parents  usually expect their children to achieve the  highest score in the classes by sending them to extra classes during the evening.This brings about an enormous strain on many children. Consequently,the children may  eventually develop some psychiatric problems which may be lifelong personality problems.   

        In conclusion,it can be reiterated that  endurance is a good value to promote in younger generations.However,the balance between optimum and over-stage should be drawn to minimize the sequential problems.",6.5
9,Mobile phones are considered essential by most people nowadays. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of mobile phones,"nowadays mobile phones are really a part of humans day to day life.we have to accept that.there is plethora of mobile phones are manufacturing by branded companies like apple,samsung etc.each phones are different from the other one based on price,specifications,quality,brand and even colour and size,weight.so we can buy a mobile phone based on our requirments.

now we will see some advantages of mobile phone.recent days mobile phone are very useful for teenager to adults.teenagers used mobile phones for academic purpose for most.becuase there is plenty of options are in it.we can download academic files through internet.eventually tutors also used gadjets wisely for taking seminars,to take notes.mobiles are mostly used for communication worldwide.in this fastest technological world humans need lots of communication.so they using mobile phones.from wakeup at morning to till sleep at night mobiles are attached with humans.its portable so we can easily take it wherever we go.its very less weight to keep in our hands.easily chargeble.very affordable to buy.

now we will see the drawbacks of humans because of mobile phones.the usage of mobiles are keeps on increasing day by day.accordingly humans are very lazy because the usage of mobiles.the wave of gadjets in humans routine life is on peek now.on the other side we all are keep on being lazier these days.moreover these mobiles are affect the relationship between family,friends.because past days of human life is much different from todays human life.in older days all are play together,work together,chatting together.but now all these things done in mobile phones itself.  

finally from my point of view, gadjets are most welcomed thing but we need to know how to bring it in our own life.we need to set some limits for gadjets.we have to separate mobile phone from our life.gadjets are playing the most iportant role in human life,but it nt to be like that.we can do plethora of works by ourself without using mobiles and gadjets.its time to wakup humans otherwise it will be a dangerous start for humans in the name of technology.",5
10,"Some organisations believe that their employees should dress smartly. Others value quality of work above appearance. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

Write your response not less than 250 words","Many companies insist on appropriate clothing for their employees. However, there are certain offices that do not expect to be formally attired at any given time. Although many organizations expect formal wear, in my opinion, the outcome of the job is more important and dressing depends on two factors such as job role requirements and it should be left at one's own discretion if not required out of the job role.

Firstly, it is believed that the ""first impression"" is the last impression. Hence most   offices insist their employees, who are either on client sites or attending customers in-house,  be dressed smartly. This helps companies build their reputation in the market. For example, people working in the sales teams are always in either suits or knee-length skirts and blouses.

Secondly, sometimes workers do like to keep themselves presentable, in spite of not falling under the category of client-facing. They do so because they perceive that if they remain neat, the day-to-day activities get accomplished quickly while dealing with others. For instance, most of the receptionists are implicitly expected to wear smart attire along with make-up.

Finally, and I agree, that the gradation of the job is based on one's own task achievement. Therefore it is more important to pay more attention to the result than the get-up of an employee. To illustrate, all IT employees are rarely in  formal apparel as it is not the requirement of their job. Another point is some workshops undertake dangerous activities. So employees should wear their clothes cautiously.  Bodyshops do not allow to wear silky, long and hanging clothes sheer out for safety purposes. Lastly, some of the women colleagues, irrespective of their job nature, will prefer to wear  makeup along with  smart clothes. An example would be the ladies from the Philippines are always in a presentable way as it is in their culture.

In conclusion, although many workplaces reiterate wearing formal dresses to look smart at work,  there are certain offices that focus on performance. In my opinion, I agree that wearing a formal dress is essential however that should be decided by the role of one's job; and also at one's own discretion when work duties do not need to do so too.",7.5
12,"in many countries, the amount of crime is increase.
what do you think are the main causes of crime?
how can we deal with those causes?","For various reasons, the number of felonies in the big part of the world is growing. Some useful solutions can be used to reduce this.

First, there is be basic reasons which are related to the socioeconomic condition of people in each part of the world. The most important of them is the lack of enough money to solve initial needs. When individuals do not have sufficient income or suitable jobs to satisfy their needs, they do specific illegal actions; for example, many poor people for food commit crimes. Moreover, almost all over the world, organized criminal groups exist, trying to reach their aims. Crimes, for instance, felon groups (such as Mafia) do any wrongdoing instead of money. So, there is a negative correlation between crimes and socioeconomic for each country, and also criminal bands can increase the number of felonies for their sinister purposes.

To decline the rate of criminals, the country's government should improve the socioeconomic condition level. They must work on increasing people's knowledge about the results of crimes and also try to improve the job situation and give jobs to everybody who has not a good position to receive enough salary. Additionally, all countries of the world must be united to prevent crimes on the international part; for instance, as many crime groups are connected in many countries, efficient international policies can decrease the number of crimes. Consequently, the decrease in crimes can be seen by working to create good jobs in each country and by having a united approach in the world to stop international crimes.

In conclusion, the amount of crimes can be increased by an inappropriate situation of people's socioeconomic condition and acts of the organized criminal groups to reach their aims. To prevent and decrease crimes, the government should create job opportunities and apply international action to reduce the percentage of crimes.",6
13,"Some people believe arts subjects such as literature and music have little importance in schools today.


To what extent do you agree with this?","Many people believe that schools responsible for improving positive science skills for the children and liberal arts don't include these goals. This essay will examine why arts and literature have a significant role in academic life. 

First of all, nowadays most   people don't believe the arts provide a new assessment of our contemporary world and being an intelligent person is not a useful quality for  work-life .  However, this perspective gives us a limited understanding and we don't see the connection of ideas between arts and literature. For instance, many scientists are always related to music and this quality creates new awareness in their brains. Thanks to this awareness, they have found remarkable inventions.

Secondly, children always need an express themselves with colours, words and notes. They have  always had insights into the following arts. Modern schools, especially Montessori schools,  have noticed the relationship between imagination and art. As well as, children who are gifted in  art and literature have a good opportunity to be  brilliant communicators in  international companies.  

To sum up, music, literature and arts create new horizons for the youngest. If we deprive  children of arts and pieces of music, they will struggle with  being creative and couldn't solve the grift problems",5.5
14,There have been major advances in technology over recent decades and this had lead to significant improvements in people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The lives of many folks have changed greatly due to some major development in automation in the past few decades. I personally agree with this view and I will explain why in this essay.

To begin, there are some minor demerits associated with the use of technology. Firstly, it leads to an increase in  the rate of cybercrime. This is now becoming the most committed crime among young adults because of the advancement in machinery, those involved in this crime can do this by hacking the bank accounts of victims and duping them with huge sums of money, they can also hack one's social media account and disguise to be the owner of the account and use it to get money from the original owner's contact thus, making individuals responsible for the crime they didn't commit and making them go through the stress of opening another media account. Secondly, a lot of people have become lazy in performing their work this is because they now depend solely on machines to do the work they ought to do. For instance, one of my cousins kept on piling up her clothes just because the washing machine in the house got spoilt and she couldn't wash with her hands because according to her she is used  to washing with the machine.

However, despite the above minor drawbacks associated with automation, I believed that it has brought a lot of positive changes in our lives. Technology has over the years played a massive role in bringing and connecting individuals together by means of bridging the gap in the different means of communication. People all over the world can communicate with each other over long distances through the help of telecommunication , messages can be sent through emails and instant reply has gotten. Social media apps like Facebook and WhatsApp has made it easier to chat with family and friends over far distance, thereby strengthening their bond. Moreover,  the advancement in technology has made life easy. Individuals can carry out multiple tasks at home with the usage of electronic gadgets. For example, if one wants to cook, they can easily utilize an electric stove and at the same time use an electric blender to blend the ingredients to cook, this saves time and also reduces the stress of doing it manually  thereby making life convenient.

To conclude, despite the minor demerits that come with the adoption of machinery, I strongly believe that it has brought a lot of improvement in the lives of people in the area of communication and in carrying out housework. Continuous improvement should be made in various aspects that are known to be hazardous to humans so as to make it more suitable for our day-to-day activities.",8.5
15,"in the future all cars buses and trucks will be driverless. the only people travelling inside these vechiles will be passengers. 
Do you think the advantage of diverless vechiles outweigh the disadvantages.","The advancement of technology has led us to a scenario where be it appliances or vehicles, they all are moving towards automation. Driverless freight is one of the upcoming changes in  society. all cars, buses and trucks will operate in complete automation and the passengers will be the only people travelling inside these transit. 

In my opinion,  although these advancements do remove the need for a driver but trusting a completely automated system won't  be the safest option always. For instance, online teaching does remove the need to come or enrol on an educational institution but in the ,end getting to interact with a teacher is the experience and teaching in itself. With driverless shipment , there will always be an uncertain risk involved that what if it gets malfunctioned? whereas when it comes to a driver we know that it is flexible and can handle uncertainties that may arrive in the middle of any moment. 

Within a country like India which is highly populated and driving on roads is itself a huge task and involves risk. Driving heavy transportation such as trucks and buses is itself quite risky and a matter of life and death as the lives of many are involved. So keeping that all in mind going for driverless shipment comes with a trust of life on the technology, Drivers not only give a human touch to our travelling experience, but also provide us with  a delightful feeling for people who love driving. 

To conclude I feel driverless gridlock involves huge risk, and technology cannot always be proven to be beneficial for  society. Although everything does come with its own advantages and advantages  we need to make sure that the disadvantages are not life-threatening.",6.5
16,"Art is considered an essential part of all cultures throughout the world. However, these days fewer and fewer people appreciate art and turn their focus to science, technology, and business.
Why do you think that is?
What could be done to encouragmore people to take an interest in the artiststs?","In earlier days people are mostly engaged in different forms of art activities.But now the situation has changed and people are more inclined towards other sectors like science, technology and business.

I will discuss more in detail  the possible reasons for people taking less interest in arts.

To commence with, in the olden days parents encourage their children to take up arts as part of their education and there is positive encouragement from the government and society as well, but now in the modern era with technological advances parents and children are also taking more interest in science and technology sectors. One of the possible reasons for this could be there is less profit and opportunities . The recognition from the government is also not that great in arts.

In contrast to arts, there are more opportunities to grow in other sectors as in today's world where   we are completely dependant on science and technology. With this, people are getting more jobs with high salaries unlike arts.People are also getting more abroad opportunities in other fields. Lack of awareness about the importance of arts is also one of the reasons for looking down at arts.

To encourage more people to take interest in arts is to create an awarness on describing the importance of arts in our culture and knowing its legacy. First of all,  Government and educational institutions should make arts as mandatory in their course, so that its importance can be taught to children from their childhood onwards. Government should also recognise the good work done in arts and should reward people , so that it will be encouraging to others.",5
17,"Some people think that having a set retirement age (e.g. 65 years) for everybody, regardless of occupation, is unfair. They believe that certain workers deserve to retire and receive a pension at an earlier age.
Do you agree or disagree?
Which types of workers do you think should benefit from early retirement?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is undeniable that retirement has been one of the most common things in everyone’s work life. While it is argued by some that leaving your job and stopping working because of having reached a particular age is unacceptable for some careers, others consider that many people could early retire and get a government pension. I agree with that viewpoint and believe that workers should be able to early retire if they like.

 

Retirement at the standard age is certainly a thing of the past. The government and companies set the age at which you can retire. After that, you will get a sum of money. Nowadays, society's perspective changes. Most employees would like to quit a job before their retirement stage. They could travel the world, seek out new experiences, or treat their illness, but they are unable to do so due to their retirement duration setting. If they resign, they will not earn the state pension. In my opinion, I believe that everyone should receive compensation money for their hard work, whether they are not 65 years old.

 

Moreover, most careers will get good effects with early retirement, for instance, doctors and nurses who take care of patients. They have spent their whole life in the hospital and have sacrificed themselves. Medical professionals are facing stress and pressured circumstances. That is why they ought to get a chance to take their time and do something else instead of working. They probably travel abroad and discover new things. To be honest, I think they need relaxing time.

 

To summarize, many people believe that setting retirement age for everyone without considering their job is biased which I strongly agree with that every profession should retire early if they wish.",6.5
18,"Societies led by males have always been prone to violence and conflicts. Thus, some believe that peace would prevail if we were governed by females leaders? To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, people are more aware of the well-being of society and most of them believes that male leaders are only responsible for violence and conflicts, while other suggested that ladies as a leader is the better option for governing our society. In this ,essay I will argue why I totally agree with the same trend in the forthcoming paragraphs. 

It is considered that both males and females have equal opportunities so that they can easily join any profession as per their choice. However, as a leader, mostly men are contesting and ladies have only a few seats in elections. To elaborate, males are already fixed their commissions with other people and business owners, so that they can easily get their votes and after winning the election, they all do by their choice either the same decision is good or bad for youngsters. Also, they make policies not only for businessmen but also for the profit of their own team. Therefore, these leaders are only getting huge money and spreading violence in our society, just only for their vote bank.

On the other hand, if the lady leaders will be elected by youngsters then they do not prefer bribes to any person, they do not have any pressure to do their work. To explicate, they are treating everyone equally and provide equal opportunity to every citizen of the nation and always try their best for the well-being of the society. For instance, the newspaper ""The Tribune"" revealed that in Singapore mostly females are leading their nation successfully and peacefully. Hence, the conflicts are less.

To sum up, I would like to restate my vista as female leaders are doing for the well-being of  society, whereas males prefer to buy a vote in the election just  to secure their own seat.",6.5
19,"Some people say now there is less communication between family members than in the past.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Communication is one of the keys to understanding people in every aspect of life. Few individuals said that there is less sharing of thoughts among  family members nowadays compared to in the past. In this essay, I will discuss why I strongly agree with the obvious comparison between now and then with regard to communicating with our loved ones. 

The main reason why there are fewer interactions of people in the family is because of the influence of high technology gadgets such as cellular phones and demanding jobs in this new era. Most of the time, people are getting lazy to interact in person because of the convenience of sending text messages anytime. For instance, individuals in some households find it faster if they just flick a text to their parents if they are not able to come out of the room for dinner for some reason. In this way, the parents of these family members are not able to distinguish the proper reason for them not joining which can also worry them and without talking to each other problems will not be resolved. Also, with a more hectic workload these days, the lesser time they can spend in their household which means fewer conversations are made and no camaraderie at all. Being an owner of a busy company and treating their workplace as their home is a perfect example. Clearly, these influences in this generation make talking more difficult. 

Secondly, compared to the past, there is no social media that delays the time of people by sharing their thoughts and problems on the network rather than opening up to their household. For example, some tend to write their dilemmas online because of the sympathy that they are getting from the netizens which they feel like they can never get from their own bubble. For this reason, there is a disconnection of communication and building gaps amongst the members of the family. 

In conclusion, this essay showed that communicating within the household is getting harder these days because of the existence of technology and the lifestyle exercised by each family member. In my own opinion, if each individual will be more responsible in engaging in conversations and start making time for their families despite the influences of this new world, communication will not be an issue at all.",8

In the following paragraphs, both of these viewpoints will be examined in detail before a conclusion is reached.

To begin with, there are numerous reasons why original libraries will be replaced by other technology types of equipment such as computer gadgets. Initially, Computers require a small space to install them. For instance, some tiny communities  that have land conditions could assist them to access the world of readings.  Furthermore, the internet is a huge factor that can provide some individuals or some rural areas have an equal opportunity to reach their learnings.

For instance, libraries have been used for social gatherings by students or master's degree researchers because of  their peaceful places. Moreover, the historic knowledge was established by books that contribute to a suitable place for learning history. As a result, library circumstance is the most effective reason why we should have actual libraries in each city.

25,Some people believe that entering the workplace after school is far more beneficial than studying at university. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is believed that taking a job after finishing high school can have many advantages than continuing to study and becoming a college student. Although that, there are some downsides which need to be considered carefully.

There would be several benefits if people choose to enter the workplace after school. Initially, people are able to be independent and not rely on anyone. Because of having financial freedom, they can earn money to pay for themselves. Furthermore, people will avoid being a financial burden for their families. They do not have to spend money for colleges or universities, which is money-saving. Secondly, there will be a chance to reinvent themselves, in fact, they just need to try another job if the previous one did not suit them. Also, they can earn practical experience throughout the jobs, and in some ways that would be more useful than theoretical knowledge.

 

Despite some plus sides, people should take this into consideration to make the right choice. Firstly, some people may get detached from studies, that is when they start to forget some knowledge but they do not notice it, since they have to put so much effort into working. Besides, people cannot decide what job suits them best because they do not have any targets for their futures. For example, some people may feel uncomfortable with their current jobs, and then they will make some bad decisions which can ruin their future in some cases.

30,"Some people prefer to live with a roommate.Others prefer to live alone.Compare the advantage of each choice.Which of these two options do you prefer?

use specific reasons to support your answer.","It is important to consider the cost of living in the major cities of the world. Although some say that dwelling with a flat buddy is a lot better experience than that without one, others argue that living by yourself is more ideal. In this essay, I will explore both sides of the argument, whilst I support the latter opinion.

On the one hand, having a flatmate can be both comfortable and cost-saving. The reason for this is that roommates can pool their resources together, which can save a lot of money for them, helping both of them to save for a rainy day. To illustrate this point, they can share utility bills, thereby, bringing down the monthly expenditures. Another advantage of sharing an apartment with someone is the warmth one receives as if one were living with a family if the roommate is friendly and caring. For example, a person will, perhaps, not feel homesick, sharing his flat with a flatmate. 

On the other hand, living alone in your own or rented apartment has its own advantages. Firstly, exposure to more privacy and less distraction can allow a person to focus on important matters in their lives with proper attention. For example, a person can learn a new skill on weekends, without any noise or disturbances, as a side hustle. Secondly, living alone can instil a sense of independence because one has to make all decisions pertaining to running and maintaining one’s residence.

In conclusion, while living with a roommate has many advantages, such as cost control and a family-like atmosphere, the advantages of living alone outweigh the benefits of sharing an apartment with someone.",8
31,"It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction.


To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?


What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behaviour to children?","Telling children to distinguish right and wrong at an early age plays a vital role. While some believe punishment is absolutely needed, some don’t. I’ll share all my opinion in the following.

Firstly, teaching children right and wrong earlier is well-accepted because it would be dangerous if children keep doing the wrong things with innocent and fun. For example, children like to put their fingers in any place. But putting in a working fan would come out with the serious results.

To enhance the memories of not doing wrong things again, many people would choose to punish children. In my opinion, I don’t totally agree with the statement. I believe punishment may help because it’s scary, but there is always another way to teach them. When I was young, I remembered I like to play matches by myself. The light and fire are so magical. Once my parents found out, mom yelled at me and was going to punish me. However, dad just brought me to the living room and showed me a video with people who playing fire but come out  injured due to the fire. Dad discussed it with me and asked how I feel about the video. I still remembered I cried at the end and told my dad I will be more careful with fire and won’t play it by myself.

In conclusion, I would like to try the way my dad treated me to every child. A real physical punishment may work but children may not really realise they are doing something wrong. If we could try to teach them right and wrong by discussing and sharing thoughts, they would keep them in their mind for a longer time.",6.5
32,"Crime & Punishment Some people believe that there should be a fixed punishment for each type of crime. Others, however, argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment. 
Discuss both of these two views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","There is no doubt that there is no punishment can replace in what victim feel, such as a trauma or even life. Some people do believe that pinishment must be fixed for each type of crime, on the other hand, others argue that circumtances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment. I do agree that punishment must be fix for each type of crime instead to search the background of the crime.

Nowdays, crime become more and more, such a kill, a rape, a rob or a coruption. This time, goverment has a lot of division to stand the right, such a police or a court. Furthermore, goverment also make a tons of regulation, detailing in what type of crime also the punishment. For example when we saw a court in television, it takes some couple of days until the punishment will decide. This depend the proves during the court. Additionally, there are no fixed punisment in court, for instance there is a coruptor that take of people's money, the number almost two trillions rupiah. The coruptor was decided to in jail for 5 years. On the other hand, there is a nanny who steal three plates from her boss, the price just a hundred thousand ruppiah. The the court was decided the nanny to go in jail for three years. Some people say, it can happen because the boss pay a proffesional lawyer.

33,men and women employed in full Samplestime jobs should share the responsibility of households chore .do you agree or disagree ? share relevant personal experiences.,"In developed countries, most men and women have full-time jobs as a result, they don't have much time to take  responsibility for their house alone . Some people argue that both men and women should share the household responsibility equally. This essay will highlight the need for sharing the workload  among men and women  and how it helps in maintaining a good relationship in the long run with relevant examples.

To begin with, In this fast-phased life, everyone is working really hard to lead a good lifestyle, and make their wishes come true. Having said that, it is really important to look after the needs of the house in order to have a balanced relationship. One should be able to adjust according to the situation without having any ego or status issues. for example, due to some urgent office work, if woman is getting late for home, men can prepare dinner for the day, or can take  responsibility for their children's homework.

In addition to this, the relationship quality married couples experience can benefit from their sharing in the challenges of day-to-day life. For example, although my own mother never worked, she was always very gracious of my father when he would take the time to help her with duties around the house. This sharing in hardship helped to strengthen my parents’ union and acts as yet another benefit to the equal divvying of household duties between married couples

After looking at how equal burden can benefit a married couple’s children and relationship, it is clear that this is an opinion that should be supported.",6
34,"Some people say that hosting an international event in a country has many benefits, others say it only brings disadvantages. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","In the modern era of times, society is polarized into two groups equally regarding the notion that whether to host an international event or not. In this context, many folks believe that organizing such competitions brings a lot of positives, while others feel they are disadvantageous. In this essay, I will shed light on this topic and provide an overall opinion.

Are there myriads of benefits of arranging a global event? Certainly, there are. First and foremost, it flourishes local businesses. This means when a country takes responsibility for a big competition like the Olympics, football world cup, and so many others, it receives a substantial amount of tourists from all around the globe. As a result, some retail businesses, say, food shops, hotel chains, and many more get customers to whom they can sell services and earn a green buck. Secondly, the organizing nation gets a free token to perform in an international event without competition. My point is that, by simply becoming a host country, it can participate in an event, such as a cricket world cup which otherwise seems impossible for a country, for instance, Kenya, Bermuda, etc. who are not good at playing cricket by qualifying matches. 

On the other hand, other guys believe that making an arrangement of such parties is disadvantageous because it creates pressure on the foreign reserve of a country. When it comes to the question of a great ceremony, notably, a sporting one that has a global appeal, it requires a significant amount of infrastructural investment in stadiums. In order to upgrade the playing arena, the government imports many things, for example, lights, carpets, etc., and loses a significant amount of its dollar reserves which causes some unlikely phenomena, noteworthy, short-term food inflation.     

To sum up, it must be said that hosting a ceremony that has an appeal from foreigners simply boost retail chains as well as provides a free ticket to the hosting country even though it creates pressure on foreign reserves. I reckon it is more advantageous for an organizing country.",8
35,"Universities are becoming increasingly expensive to operate. In some countries, money from taxation has met these costs. However, this is not always enough to maintain the quality of universities. What problems can occur when universities do not have enough money? Suggest alternative ways that universities can be funded.","Educational institutions are getting way costlier to run the show in some western countries, which could affect the standard of education, though the government is meeting their costs. In this essay, I will explore the problems associated with increasing expenses of a college and suggest possible solutions for them. Firstly, I will share an issue related to insufficient money and a viable solution ,further I will discuss another related problem and suggest a possible solution.

To start with, the world is developing in a rapid phase and the standard of living has increased. The Universities are unable to meet their expenses regarding staffing, and other institutional burdens. Money is a prominent aspect of development and maintenance, though governments are providing possible support to the colleges that are unable to  themselves sustain. To further, restrain this issue educational institutions need to provide in-house part-time jobs to the students. As a result, costs will be reduced and it will be a positive change. For instance, western countries are adopting more students to cope with expenses.

Furthermore, the standard quality of education is decreasing due to increasing costs which lead to poorer outcomes. In addition, quality of education is the most important aspect for a student and also the government. A possible resolution to this issue is, to hire more international qualified lecturers for a decent CTC. Consequently, it will help the university to lower their expenses on hiring staff and gives them a more reliable solution. For example, many other Asian countries are hiring cheaper staff with quality teaching.

To sum up,the government is doing its best to bring balance to the university but cannot come out of the situation  because the cost of living is growing rapidly. In my opinion, educational bodies should take possible steps as suggested in the essay and see decent outcomes.",7

Since the first atomic bombs were developed, nuclear technology has provided governments with the ability to totally destroy the planet. Yet the technology has been put to positive use as an energy source and in certain areas of medicine. To what extent is nuclear technology a danger to life on earth? What are the benefits and risks associated with its use?","In the modern era of globalization, nuclear technology has been developed in numerous aspects beyond human recognition. However, my perspective is that the merits outweigh the risks. In this essay, I am going to examine both statements in the forthcoming paragraphs.

On the one hand, there are numerous reasons why nuclear function has strongly contributed to many related industries. This means that leads directly impacts humankind in better ways. Initially, nuclear energy is a reliable source of energy because it is not dependent on natural resources. For instance, wind energy always obviously requires a source from wind turbines, while nuclear energy can manufacture its power which leads to an enormous factor for humankind to live longer on this planet without natural powers. Furthermore, sufficient fuel availability could apparently assist people when they are progressively facing problems with natural power shortages. 

On the other hand, a conflict between countries is caused by using nuclear as weapons. To illustrate, the memorable situation that all citizens in this world evidently realize is Chornobyl and Fukushima in Japan which were bombed detroritalely effects. As a result, some individuals are against contributing to nuclear fuel widespread due to its harmful power effects. Moreover, besides mentioned risks, building nuclear potential is expensive and the operation cost keeps rising. This is a pressing issue that the authorities should take responsibility for before the world's resources run out of their capability.

In conclusion, the government should seriously educate and promote how many benefits of using nuclear power . Consequently, nuclear potential should be the effective power resource that is admitted and valued rather than the past.",9
38,The development of tourism contributed to English becoming the most prominent language in the world. Some people think this will lead to English becoming the only language to be spoken globally. What are the advantages and disadvantages to having one language in the world?,"In this contemporary era, the booming of the tourism industry is promoting the English language globally. There is an opinion by a few individuals that this will create a situation where only English will be used worldwide. Creating a single language for the world population has its o.wn merits and demerits which will be discussed in the forthcoming paragraphs.

On the one hand, there are many positive sides to making one language for all mankind. The primary is, that there will be no confusion among people from different nations. To be more precise as they don't require to learn other languages to communicate. Secondary, this will help the environment since several books on international subjects are published in native languages that will not be needed. If everybody knows the English language they can read International books.

Furthermore, multinational companies can do business efficiently and provide more jobs to youth. For instance, these companies will not require any interpreter in board meetings, as well as applicants, will not be rejected because of the language barrier. As a result, this will convert the whole globe into one big family.

On the other hand, certain communities are opposed to this. They find a plethora of disadvantages in this phenomenon. Firstly, this one language concept will ruin the culture of other languages. Secondly, many historical books are written in different languages which are treasures for humankind. People will forget the importance of that incredible heritage. Thirdly, a non-English speaker will feel his language is inferior to English. This will not only resist him from not speaking his mother tongue as well impact his psychology since he will give more importance to English tradition. To exemplify, as per an article published in ' The Hindu' most Metropolitan cities of India like Delhi and Mumbai residents are incapable to speak numbers in the Hindi language.

To conclude, these days travellers have access to move to any part of the world due to advancements in technology. This emphasizes of the English language is spoken at the world level. Although it has a plethora of advantages, there are drawbacks associated with this that can not be ignored.",6.5
39,Governments in many countries are replacing old buildings such as art galleries and town halls with new ones. Is this a positive or a negative development?,"In the contemporary epoch, numerous authorities tend to replace historical structures such as art galleries and town halls with modern ones. Personally, I strongly believe this approach is a negative development as, firstly, these buildings are a part of human history and should be preserved as a heritage for the younger generation and, secondly, it may have a negative impact on the state´s exchequer.

It cannot be denied that  historical buildings are part of the cultural legacy as they depict human history through their architecture. Replacing them with the new ones would be, undoubtedly, an imprudent approach as they take part in the education process as well. Linked to this, for instance, a vast number of school trips are usually made with the purpose to show children historical buildings, which might help them to imagine how their ancestors lived. To elaborate the importance of old structures further, the architecture students spend hours studying historical buildings in person, as it offers a noteworthy opportunity to understand the details of each architectural style in a better way.

Moreover, it is irrefutable proof that historical attractions are an inevitable part of financial resources for the state´s exchequer, as they tempt numerous tourists each year. Additionally, tourists enhance the economy of a particular country in numerous other ways, such as usually paying for the accommodation, food and transport. Therefore, it should be one of the politicians’ paramount aims to preserve and revamp the historical buildings.

	To conclude, from the aforementioned examples, removing old structures has more drawbacks, as they are a heritage for future generations and are a reliable source of the country´s income.",7.5
41,"Some people say that art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are an essential part of education, and every school should include them in its syllabus. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and examples from your own experience.","Art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are fundamentals that enrich our lives. However, some parents say schools concentrate on teaching more academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature and history. In my opinion, both academic and arts subjects should be taught and I will expand on the pros and cons of including arts in the school program further on in this essay.

On the one hand, academic subjects are often required when we get into higher educations. Academic subjects may be considered as precious basement in the academic world. Personally, I have never taken an entrance exam of art subjects for high school or university. In other words, schools measured my academic abilities using academic subjects, not art subjects. To suit the current educational system, many parents in my home country, Japan, send their children to cram schools to study academic subjects deeply.

On the other hand, art subjects can strengthen the creativity and flexibility of individuals. Liberal arts, which include cultural understanding and knowledge, also include other arts subjects. In addition, we are living in the era of automation and artificial intelligence which are replacing human labor and office work more and more. In this regard, human creativity becomes more important. Therefore, art subjects are being more in demand to make a difference between individuals and computers. 

In conclusion, academic and arts subjects should blend in a school syllabus in a balanced way. Art subjects can also nature a better personality in individuals, so participation in these classes should be encouraged as well as academic achievements.",5.5
42,Nowadays celebrities earn more money than politicians. What are the reasons for this? Is it a positive or negative development?,"Nowadays celebrities make more money compared to people working in politics. This essay will look at the possible causes of this tendency and explain why, in my opinion, this is a negative development.

There are two main reasons why celebrities generate more income than politicians. One of them is that with the advent of the Internet, there are more ways available for celebrities to earn money, such as online streaming services. For example, singing a song in a YouTube video with some advertisements enables them to easily make a few million dollars. Another cogent reason for this is the growing global concerns over excessively high remuneration for political leaders, which can easily lead to public discontent. In response to such criticism, many governments have decided to reform the reward system for lawmakers, sending their salaries on a downward trend.

I personally believe that this development is relatively negative for several reasons, with the main one being the potential corruption scandals this issue can create. The enormous salary gap between celebrities and political leaders might discourage the legislators from putting in work or even motivate them to commit crimes such as money laundering. In addition, the relatively low salary for stressful jobs of governors may deter people with foresight on politics from becoming politicians. This is particularly undesirable because it would result in low level of citizens’ loyalty to their incompetent government, creating unstable society with more crime and other social problems.

In conclusion, the fact that celebrities are paid more than political leaders now is caused by a wider variety of income sources available to them, and supported by the social norm that a politician should not be a profit driven professional. However, I believe this is a negative trend which may lead to more political corruption and less talented governments.",6.5
43,The growth of online shopping will one day lead to all shops in town and city closing do you agree or disagree?,"In the modern era, the growth of technology has impacted the way people shop, for instance people use their smartphones to buy in the online shops and it will come just in a couple of days. Most  the people said that it is easier instead to go to traditional markets. In this ,essay I will discuss that one-day online shopping will ease shops in town and city.

Firstly, there is nothing that can't stop the growth of technology, for ,instance the internet. This time it really is the disrupted of a conventional life's, such as the shops. Online markets have become more and more, also  users. These markets give many  products with picture and detail of condition, ,moreover, the price is so competitive. Then, people can easily compare all the products in some online shops just using their smartphones. Furthermore, it will delivered to your home just for a mount of day,  ondepend the distance from the shop to your house.

On the other hand, the number of shops in town have become started to decrease gradually. For some things like vegetables or animal shops, they can still to operated for the last. ,Furthermore like vegetables have expired date shorter than other products, such as electronics or clothes. Additionally, traditional market will stand to last, this cause  old people to more like to come directly to market instead to go online.

As a result, online shopping will lead the system of shopping, moreover, it will grow more and more. It will reduce the number of shops in town and city, but traditional markets will stay to last  due to old consumers who more like tocome see the products directly, for ,example old people. In another word, online shopping will still grow but cant ease all the conventional markets.",5.5
44,"Some people say that it is a waste of time to focus on future and important to focus on present. 
To what extent do u agree or disagree ?","Many people feel that emphasizing on future is waste of time and rather focusing on the present. In this essay, I will explore both the viewpoints and why the general public thinks so. Firstly, I will discuss future thinking and, secondly the importance of present living.

To begin with, the more younger generations are focusing on prediction, which leads to the security of life and enjoying the retirement stage. In addition, people are able to balance their financial prospects. For example, public needs are never-ending to survive, although they have to think about the future and save sufficient bank balance. Furthermore, to achieve certain goals a person has to plan for  future outcomes and solve obstacles they may face during transformation. It is very important to figure out possible outcomes. For instance, companies or persons wanting to see themselves in a higher position  have to work and plan accordingly which leads to colourful results.

On the other hand, focusing on the present situation is also an important aspect of  people's lives as they have various commitments in society. Further, people are social human beings who need to live in the present and enjoy a glimpse of nature and spend quality time with their families. For example, social bonding has proven that the public needs a balanced life to live. Moreover, focusing on the day makes a person happier and feels less stressed, which leads to a healthy lifestyle. For instance, loads of folk are quitting their jobs to travel around the globe, just to relax and come out of pressure.

In summary, focusing on both futuristic and present situations is very important to lead a successful and healthier life. In my opinion, I totally disagree with the argument. In addition to this, both statements go hand in hand to maintain our happiness.",6
46,"Some people believe that it is best to accept a bad situation, such as an unsatisfactory job or shortage of money. Others argue that it is better to try and improve such situations.


Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.


Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","To accept or not to accept? This is a question. Some people believe that we would better accept if we are stuck in a reverse situation such as unemployment or financial difficulties, while others hold the opposite view that it is necessary to try our best to improve those unsatisfactory situations. In my point of view, it is best to take action to change our situations first; if it fails, we then try to accept the disappointing result.

On the one hand, it is no doubt that there are several occasions where we can hardly change society. For example, due to the spread of COVID-19, a number of industries have been affected heavily such as tourism and international trade, which contribute to the shortage of money, and even unemployment in the amount of population. It can be seen that it is difficult to earn money in this context of society and it could not be improved and return to prosperity in the short term. Therefore, we need to change our attitudes and keep active in life by accepting these unfavourable situations.

On the other hand, it is widely accepted that opportunities are always given to those prepared. If we do not take measures and use our wist to make a progress, nothing will be changed. For instance, students found it hard to find a satisfactory job after their graduation because of their lack of practical experience. However, some of them were not willing to improve themselves by participating in the training courses and sharpening their professional skills, while others tried their best to do vocational training and collect useful information about jobs. As a result, those who had improved themselves achieved their goals. Consequently, it is vital to take action when we are in a bad situation.

To summarize, in my opinion, the first step is to make the best use of our resources to make a change in some troublesome situations. If we are not able to improve it, we can try to accept it.",8
47,Many people today are worried about young children using video games. What problems might these games cause for children and society as a whole? How could these problems be reduced?,"Nowadays, gaming consoles have become popular amongst teenagers. In this essay, I will explore some of the problems these devices cause upon children and society as a whole and how we may get rid of these effectively and completely. 

To begin with, playing video games is addictive and it can cause some serious problems in the area of time management for teenagers. To illustrate this point, a child may start skipping learning new ideas and concepts at school, doing homework, and meeting their friends for the sake of playing virtual games on their computers for some additional hours than usual. On the contrary, If adolescents become fond of these gaming devices altogether, the next generation would struggle to make their ends meet, thereby, becoming a burden on society. This would probably increase the rate of crime in society since most of them would not be employable. 

On the other hand, I believe, this issue can be addressed effectively. Firstly, child locks can be imposed by the parents on gaming devices to restrict limited hours of gaming. For instance, a child should not be allowed to play with their gadget for more than 1 hour each day. Secondly, parents should encourage their children to learn more, make friends, and follow some hobbies rather than spending most of their time on these electronic gadgets. In contrast, If not, they will face many difficulties in building a personality or forming their own opinions.

In conclusion, while too much playing of video games can pose many serious threats, such as addiction and poor management of time, in the development of adolescents, these problems can be addressed by referring to the points mentioned above.",8
49,Any country should be able to sell goods to other countries without the restrictions of the government. Do you agree or disagree?,"There should be  free trade among nations with no limitations from local governing bodies on the import of items from  other nations. This will allow  access to globally available technology and medications to everyone. Furthermore, it will establish a good relationship between people of different localities. It will increase the economical gap among the republics. I partially agree with the statement and elaborate further in the next coming paragraphs. 

To begin with, this will allow the developed states to export their products to underprivileged areas and in ,return they can get  cheaper raw materials from those territories. Additionally, those republics can achieve a workforce with lower wages, this means that such companies will make more profit and contribute to the GDP of the country. Moreover, well-educated and skilful people will migrate to developed countries, meaning brain drain will take place in third-world places. For instance, some African nations going through a shortage of doctors and nurses due to  migration. Hence, this will widen the gap between the terrains.

On the other hand, poor countries will become  poorer in regard to money,manpower and technical skills. For example, the duty-free export agreement with China leads Pakistan to the edge of bankruptcy with inflation rising in  every field. Such kind of business reduces the foreign currency reserve of the region to a critically low level, pushing them into debt. Similar way labour and service industry is going to suffer as there will be no customers.

In conclusion, considering the effects of  open trade on both exporters and importers, it will be harmful to the recipient party and fruitful to sending company. That's why I agree in part with the idea of tax-less transactions.",8
50,"Some people like to try new things, for example, places to visit and types of food. Other people prefer to keep doing things they are familiar with.
Discuss both attitudes and give your opinion.","Change the routines or stay with the old ones? Some people intend to try new options. However, others choose to stick with things they have already done. Although living life as the latter group can be less challenging and more confidential, I prefer to adventure my life.

Living an exciting life is a quality that some people are seeking. A great sense of curiosity opens many doors for this group of people, where they can experience new things and live lives filled with many adventures. Moreover, the intention of trying new things rather than doing routines seems to also relate to the characteristics of people. In other words, this type of person avoids being imprisoned with repetition and limited options. Instead, they opt to take risks by doing new things in order to feel lively. So, choosing to step beyond routines is the result of being curious about life and tending to feel excited by it.

In contrast, some people tend to do things in which they can have confidence and reasonable control over the situation. The secure feeling of being in a safe zone is the main reason to stick with routines. To be more precise, repeating certain things, such as eating in particular restaurants or preferring pastimes in familiar places, lets people predict the situation. By doing this, they avoid trials and errors, which can be surprising and out of control. As a result, they feel more confident in their safe zone and can accurately predict the outcome of their actions.

In conclusion, the convenience of staying in a safe zone and having a predictable life makes people keep doing things in the way that they have already done them. Despite the satisfying feeling that a controlled life can have, we must let our curiosity and the risk-taking part of us change the boring routines into vibrant life.",8.5
51,"Many working people get little or no exercise either during the working or in their free time, and have health problems as a result.
Why do many working people not get enough exercise?
What can be done about this problem?","Most of the employed people poses wellness issues due to lack of physical fitness activities in both leisure time and week days. The essay will firstly, discuss how workload of working people has caused the problem and secondly, it will explain the way that employer funded exercise programs are capable of mitigating the concern.

To begin, employees are more busy with their job responsibilities than never before and it has also reduced the free time for an individual. Although, the standard working hours are defined as 9.00 am to 5.00 pm, it is not practiced in many of the organizations. Majority of the employees works late hours to fulfill their tasks on time having the expectations on promotions. Therefore, workaholics do not concentrate on their physical health. For example, my brother used to maintain a balanced healthy life before he joined his present employment. However, now he does not have a spare time to continue his exercises with the busy work schedule.

On the other hand, best way to overcome the prevailing concern will be to introduce employer backed health improvement plans. It is not that people are reluctant to engage in exercise but the employment has compelled to o that. Thereby, workers will enthusiastically engage in sports activities if those are promoted and financed by the company allowing them to involve during office hours. For instance, one of our client companies pays their employee’s membership fee of gyms on behalf of them with the intention to upgrade wellness of their working family.

In conclusion, it is clear that existing health matters of public are a result of humungous workload of employees and it can be minimized by implementing employer supported fitness activities.",5.5
52,People should spend less money on unnecessary things and save more for the future. How much do you agree with this opinion and why?,"In this cutting-edge Era, throw-away culture has become a trend, and as a ,result spending more on useless things.Individuals should save for their future. However, I believe in the same. This essay discusses supporting arguments and explanations. 

To begin with, initially, people nowadays are too much into entertainment namely, movies, restaurants and many more. This kind of expenditure is a waste of money. For instance, researches prove that as the average annual income around the world  increased, spending on unnecessary activities also grew. Moreover, a luxurious lifestyle is  currently in the swing,  that is, purchasing more than what they need. Social media is creating a false influence on human about once living. For example, one of my friends,  who uses social media the most, buys things lavishly, without having concern about savings, the most surprising part is, that she bought all those by the advertisements on social media. 

    Secondly, spending a huge percentage of earnings on junk food, as a result, Home cooking is becoming extinct. Hotel food is not only costly but also health hazardous, as a consequence, sparing on the  hospitals too. To an epitome, most of the studies proved the same. This money can be used for something useful either in education,  such as, in giving quality education to their children, accessing useful resources for them, which may help their career indirectly or  as savings for the future, for bright choices. Adding on, one can invest in the business as well as in expanding them if needed. 

To conclude, I do agree with the given statement. Unnecessary expenditures like roadside food and  spending on more than what we need should be avoided. Instead saving for later and investing for acquiring opportunities may be significant.",8
53,"The gap between the rich and poor is widening in many countries. What problems can this cause, and what can be done to reduce the gap?","In today's ,world developing countries are facing a major problem where richer is getting richer and richer but on the other hand poor people are becoming poorer this is because of multiple reasons like inflation lets us see some of the reasons causing the problem in the following paragraph.

To start the prices of goods are being increased monthly or yearly at the same time the taxes on products are also been increased due to this inflation is growing rapidly for instance when I was a child I use to get  ice cream for 10 rupees but nowadays it's hard to even get a cone ice cream for the same price here we can see how badly the prices have increased furthermore there has been an implementation of taxes on ice creams also.

The second point increases in pay of education the fare of this sector have boomed so much that to get a quality of education parents are spending lakhs of rupees for example my parents got a quality study in free of cost but today for my studies they are spending lakhs of rupees in this situation rich can bear the amount but poor people can't afford the money to solve the issue people there needs to be no discrimination in education that means every child needs to get a quality of study at a fair price or at free of cost.

To conclude the richer will become richer until the distribution of wealth is unequal to do so the taxes for the poor need to be reduced and the income of every employee needs to be equal in the sense everyone sustains the economy moreover the wealth must be distributed by the government to poor in the terms of schemes etc by this the economy grows as well as the gap between rich and poor will reduce.",6.5

55,Mobile phones are considered essential by most people nowadays. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of mobile phones,"In recent years, the popularity of mobile phones has seen a long-term gradual increasing over the world. Some of the population believed that it has significant beneficial for human, others argue that these devices have negative impact. In this essay, both pros and cons will be explained and provided the reason why I think this innovation facilitates to human.

To begin with, mobile phones significantly simplify our life. In other word, these devices are useful and sufficient tool in case of emergency. For instance, in case a person faces a complication or urgently requires help from others, he can easily to reach someone appropriate by making a phone call. Besides, these technological products allow the users connect the internet for accessing information to solve the issues immediately, increasing the efficiency. For example, a survey conducted in Hong Kong reports that citizens prefer to use the mobile phones searching the solution online rather that in black and white, especially, related to electronic devices.

On the other hand, it significant causes physical health and disturbs your original plan if there have unlimited use. To illustrate this point, these devices allow the user communicate with their parents and relatives online, it is not mandatory to leave home for some meetings and events, and the population tend to less physical excises. Moreover, a vast of teenagers not only use the mobile phones for communication purposes, but also playing games, spending time on online social platforms. For instance, Scientists report that large majority of youngsters are addicted in mobile phones for entertaining purposes, it is significant harmful to their health because of lack of excises, casing eye issues, increasing the heart disease, and diabetes. 

In conclusion, these technological devices significantly increased the efficiency on problem and communication despite it causes addiction and health problems. In personally, I believed that these devices contributes to our daily life in a positive way if it is well-monitored on time spend.",5.5
56,"Some parents think it is good to have mobile phones for their children, others disagree with it. Discuss both sides and give your opinion","Due to technological advances, everyone has access to electronic phones, but opinions vary on whether a cell phone should be given to youngsters by parents or not. While I believe that a balanced approach should adopt to the limited usage of such wireless phones for education and entertainment.

A handphone provides a sense of security and facilitates young people with ways of communication with near ones when required. To illustrate, in case of emergency or in stranger danger, a child can easily inform  known people as feeling safe. According to a survey, published in New York Times, the crime rate reduces dramatically worldwide related to small age groups due to the high availability of communication devices among the young generation which is fully equipped with other high-tech features such as cameras and recorders to secure from serious threats. Therefore, a mobile phone should be given to children for making sure they are safe.

However, the modern generation normally gets addicted to video games on their mobiles and excessively uses social media apps at this young age. This could be detrimental to their overall health and well-being. For example, harmful rays transmit from such devices cause serious health hazards such as heart diseases and too much time spent on screens leads to a sedentary lifestyle that results in obesity in young people. Consequently, if caretakers allow open access to cellular devices to their children, will emerge medical issues rapidly.

To conclude, I have a balanced opinion about both views regarding giving access to mobile phones to the young generation by parents. I suggest that limited use of a mobile phone should be enabled for children for their benefit but under the supervision of adults. Otherwise, excessive use might worsen health conditions at a young age.",8.5
57,All students should study art and music in school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Art and music have always played an important role in our society. But many people posed a question why we have to spend time teaching these subjects at school. In this essay, I will elaborate why I agree that the subjects should be include in curriculum.

To begin with, I believe that both art and music strongly contribute to ability of children to be creative. These two course able to shape children’s brain and allowed them to think outside of the box. During art and music class, for example, children are usually asked to invent something new. Therefore, It forces their brain to think and come up with new ideas. As you can see, these classes create opportunities for youngsters to think apart from maths and science.

Moreover, music classes should be mandatory because they provide students with a chance to discover unknown talents. Since students spend most of their time at school learning traditional subjects like math and science, students who have artistic talent may not have a chance to discover this ability. In this respect, making music classes compulsory will ensure that students receive a well-rounded education that prepares them for their future. Therefore, even if students do not have artistic talent, participating in music classes in high school should be required.

In conclusion, it is undeniable that art and music classes are still essential nowadays and should be included in the school because they have significant benefits both in term of creativity and exploring themselves, which will positively effects their future life.",6
58,"Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Several individuals believe that the college pupils should learn what they are interested in, meanwhile others realize that universities should prioritize advantageous subjects that are taught to students. In my opinion, while the concept of usefulness of a subject is debatable, I support that a more interest-based will be more beneficial to students.

On the one hand, the disparity of majors brings an innovative learning process which is expected to be able to support the competence of higher education graduates to be a superior generation who are able to work splendidly according to their passions and competencies. For example, students who are interested in the arts will develop their talents more deeply compared to when they learn other programs that they detest because it will make them more frustrated. In addition, the diversity of fields are assumed to balance the supply and demand of job vacancy varieties.

On the other hand, having a compulsory lesson at university can force students to learn more and more inventively, especially in the fields of science and technology. Additionally, by studying those, they are honing their technical abilities for a more promising future. For example, most large companies today prioritize graduates who have the ability in the field of technology development. Moreover, they are also believed to have higher salaries compared to those who are proficient in administrative science.

To sum up, in my view, the universities should determine the programs that suit the recent vacancies, which must be balanced with the market of the prospective students’ interest.",6
59,"Some people believe that improve public health should increase the number of sports facilities, others believe that it has little effect and need other measure to improve it. Discuss both view and give your opinion.","In this concurrent world it is undoubtedly true that some people cocur that public health are less effective and need other facilities to improve. However,I quibble from them and put forward my idea that public health is more effective and it increase the number of sport facilities.

However,thae public in general tend to different view that public health have less effective and need other to improve the facilities which has multiple reasons. To start with some people counter that all people should have been healthy for any kind of sports, because health is more important in our daily lifestyle. To increase any type of health issue the facilities plays major role in any person life. The more facilities for any kind of workout help the people to get easily and can get motivated by the equipment. To insist, the gym play major role in public so people can go to gym and become healthy and fit person.

The subsequent evidence are obtain to prove the concept of public health should increase the number of sports facilities. The top notch rapid factor if public will be healthy and fit so they can play any sports, and facilities regarding the sports will also increase. If public will be healthy they will get less deases in their body. For example, If public want to become more healthy the facilities in gym will increase and sports also get more people. So the country also get affected. Thus, it is clear that public health can increase the sport as well as sports facilities.

To conclude, there are innumerable strong factor supporting the public health can increase the sports facilities, it's opposite also cannot be overlooked or controlled. Consequently I firmly agree with given statement.",5
60,Popular events like the football world cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you argree or disagree with this opinion?,"The Olympics or world cup tournaments related to famous sports cultivate opportunities for nations to solve conflicts and promote a feeling of patriotism through secure means. I firmly agree with this notion and I will discuss the advantages of such sporting events in this essay with suitable illustrations.

To enhance peace, tolerance and understanding between nations, the event of multinational sporting competitions plays a crucial role. As a country might take initiative to invite other nations to take part in such games because it helps to resolve any previous misunderstandings and build positive relationships politically. To illustrate, sports activities are a healthy way to kill negativity and create global peace as people and world leaders bring together. Moreover, cultural barriers can weaken as people get together beyond borders but it also provides a peaceful way to give vent to one’s patriotic feelings by supporting one nation’s team.

In other ways, if a country hosts global games competitions, the economic condition will improve in that province. For example, tourists associated with such events want to spend money on local goods and services and contribute to a nation’s economic growth. Furthermore, a hosting nation attains universal recognition as these events bring prestige and honour to a country and athletes receive a huge opportunity to represent their countries in a relevant sport. Thereby, the spirit of sport and competitiveness rises in people nationally. 

To conclude, I totally believe that international game competitions are a great deal to ease nations’ tensions and support nationalism in a positive way. Therefore, such sports tournaments must organise at an international level to bring peace and safety globally.",8.5
61,"Some people view teenage conflict with their parents as a neccessary part of growing up, whilst others see it as something negative.
 
Discuss your both  views and give your own opinion.","Nowadays, most of people live in a modern world and they choose modern life-styles. They spend lots of time with their cellphones or on the internet. These modern people send emails or types letters in their computers instead of write it down by their own hand. Therefore, some people suggest that the handwriting is going to be extinct and no need to be taught in schools anymore. Please let me stand opposite side of this idea.   

Firstly, writing by hand is one of the important steps of learning alphabet by children. Moreover, scientists suggest that children could learn better by connecting to the words with their minds and bodies, for instance: teaching process of apple. Teacher should ask children to listen to a word apple, look at the picture of it and write it down on a paper after that teacher could show the real apple to children. Scientists mention that during this process children could sink their sensory inputs and understand how to write words. Hence, handwriting is an important necessary learning step. 

Secondly, having a beautiful Handwriting is an artistic branch. People dedicated their passion to their lovers by letter with outstanding handwriting about thirty years ago and we had had many poems about this love expression. Now, maybe those attitudes are not very common but still working. Hence, sending a massage with paper letter that contains your handwriting always has a different persisting meaning than a type letters or emails. Moreover, some psychologists believe that handwriting has some personal aspects of writer and could help people to express their feeling to each other. Therefore, they suggest, it is better to write cards in special occasions instead of typing of mailing.

 To conclusion, we should consider that the handwriting is not useful like before and emails or typing on computers and using cellphones are more functional and faster, but I believe that we should not stop our children from learning how to write a beautiful letter by their hands.",5
62,Should students allowed to speak in class or not. Explain with an example.,"Classes are always interesting and useful to attend as they enhance our knowledge for our better future and life. Some students like to attend the classes in which teachers take lectures and there is no talking with the students. While some students would like to attend the classes in which they also do some of the talking such as asking their doubt or reading any book chapter. As far as I am concerned, I like those classes in which students are also allowed to do some talk instead of sitting silently all the time. I think this way for two reasons, which I will explore in this essay. 

As an initial point, I would like to say that,  if any student gets some doubt while  to listening the lecture then he or she should be allowed to clear that problem at the same moment. Because, when we clear our problem without any delay, I feel that we understand things in a better way. For example, I remember, when I was in  high school, I used to have many questions while listening to the lecture but no student was allowed to talk about queries during the lecture instead students can ask their queries after the class, which did not happen always because just after five minutes the next class starts. In this ,way questions of mine and of many students were never asked.

Subsequently, if students are allowed to read any chapter or to speak about their views regarding any topic, then this will help in enhancing their speaking skills. In, class students are reading or discussing their viewpoints in front of many students and also in front of the teacher, which is a good idea to improve our speaking abilities. 

In conclusion, I believe that getting a chance to speak in class has its own advantage, such as it aid in clearing  doubts and enhancement of speaking quality.",6
63,"Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however, argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","It usually appears that humankind is divided into two sides  upside and downside. One particularly reason some people think that with the sin people  would have to punishment amount of they have done while, others seem like they did some harmful with some specific reason by crime about that people should be more flexible about deciding on the punishment. In this essay, I intend to discuss both these views and at the end of this ,essay I give my own opinion. 

On the one hand, more and more people believe that there some offences should be more tough punishment by the law because crime is getting significantly increased in a few decades. Put more simply, some young people didn't know about they are getting some kind of violent and obstaractacle. As a result, there were noticing everything that happened after. One of the perfect examples of this is last week I heard a true story from a Youtube blog that is brave women tell her story of   violence by their close people when she was a child but that person who does this harmful offence already died without any punishment by law. That is a pity girl is living like hell. Therefore, I totally agree with this statement who have done some sin  have to deserve some punishment for fit. 

On the other hand, some people think that crime has done their sin in some other circumstances of an individual offence. That is to say that they might cover their own body from the freaky people,Consequently they had been some crime without their brain. One particularly good example of this is a 2021 phone call to the police officer about 2 Bulgars from the small groceries market. They stole just soda cola 2l. the Bulgars are just kids about 15 years old but they were getting tough punishments such as spending 12 years in  jail. However, I disagree with this statement.

by way of conclusion, I once again restate my view that some murderers have to get super hard punishment for what they have done by the law ,not outlaw. But some other crime just protects their body from a bad person so that they have done some offence. I also believe that  judgement is always true.",7
64,"In recent years, some countries have experienced very rapid economic development. This has resulted in higher standards of living in urban areas but not in the countryside.

What problems could this cause? How could these be reduced?","In the last few decades, many countries have encountered economical growth the fact of urban developments instead of rural places. This essay will describe the challenges for people that emerge due to the fact of urbanization, such as poor hygiene and health conditions, and offer some suggestions to overcome these issues.

There are numerous problems caused by the metropolitan area's growth in terms of elevated standards of living. One of them is poor sanitation and housing conditions because the intensive population shifts in cities from the rural field. To illustrate, many contagious diseases such as cholera or typhoid, spread from the rural community and their livestock in less space and overcrowded areas. This further affects urban air and water quality. Consequently, urbanisation owing to less income and unemployment often has become the potential cause of poor nutrition in the masses in developed places.

A series of problems occur as a consequence of urbanisation and the developed area advancements. To improve such a situation, local governments can interfere and implement some effective measures. For example, enhancing opportunities and facilities can combat the difficulties of a metropolis. More job options with satisfactory wages can support a person’s income; thereby providing enough nutrition and improving people’s overall health.

To conclude, urban areas attract many people from a rural background as a result of the high status of living; however, there are potential issues accounted for the increasing population such as spreading contagious diseases, poor nutrition and health concerns. Therefore, local governments must concentrate on providing more opportunities for jobs and medical care facilities for improving such conditions.",7.5
65,Luck is the most crucial in one's success. Do you agree?,"There are some who believe that luck is the most vital element towards success. However, I do not believe the same.

Today, the majority perceive affluent individuals to be so lucky based on their financial status, however, I think that this notion dismisses the efforts these groups have put on to reach the top. For instance, when we see celebrities appear on TV, we immediately think how they must have been so lucky to acquire such skills in acting, singing, or dancing. But for me, what they all have in common is hard work. We may not know it but some actors may have been rejected numerous times for roles in movies, or a famous singer constantly practices for days until their voices start to sound hoarse. Given that they’re naturally talented, the time invested and energy cannot be dismissed. Everyone starts from the bottom and improves their craft to the point of their triumph.

Another factor crucial to one’s success is passion. When people enjoy what they are doing, the fun they have immediately outweighs the setbacks they face. An example of this is Manny Pacquiao. If he had given up boxing because of losing numerous fights, would he be able to achieve what he has now? He kept on going, trained day and night to build his strength and stamina and ended up being the Philippine’s most successful boxer who even gained international recognition.

To conclude, luck can also be part of one’s success, however, it is my belief that hard work and passion are the most crucial to being successful and not just sheer luck.",8
67,"Popular events like football world cup and other international sporting occassions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The first given chart shows the number of marriages and divorces in the USA between 1970  and 2000, while the second one illustrates the proportion of American adults' marital status in 1970 and 2000.

While the figure for marriages decreased, the figure for divorces fluctuated in that period. It is clear that the proportion of the mature American marital status, such as never married, married, widowed, and divorced, changed clearly in 1970 and 2000.

According to the first bar graph, the figure for marriages was the highest in 1970 and 1980, at 2,5 million, and then it declined obviously to 2 million in 2000. Whereas the figure for divorces was the lowest in 1970, at 1 million, it peaked at nearly 1,5 million, but then decreased again to 1 million in 2000.

Following the second graph, the proportion of married status was the greatest percentage in comparison with other statuses, at 70% in 1970, and then it decreased to 60% in 2000. The figure for never married status increased from around 15% to 20% between 1970 and 2000, while the figure for divorced increased from 1% to 10%. The figure for widowed decreased from 8% to 7% in that period.",5
68,A knowledge of maths is not important for most jobs nowadays. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"In modern-day, technology has become more popular and widespread across the world. In order to keep up with this trend, we need to apply knowledge and experience.Today, I will discuss with you guys the two sides that apply to the situation.

It is beneficial for people who specialize only in math and have a high risk of doing not so good to the other subject.Secondly, it will be easier for people to find apply themselves a job, business or even create their own industries.Thirdly,people can show off and popular themselves to other people.For example, John who is a math person can feel more confident about his ability and skill without worries about other things  and pressure.

On the other hand, the future will continue to grow and increase so us people have to keep going with not only one speciality but a lot of good ability to be recommended by people and co-workers. As I said, we have to grow to adapt to the high risk of change apply to most jobs and ourselves.Learning math is good but it is not good enough to move forward toward a bright and technological future.Like Donald Trump who is being renowned by everyone and one of the most impressive people to change for a better future.

To summarise, the main point is people should work hard to keep up and find a job, improve and finds a new ability hidden inside themselves. In my personal view, I positively agree with this statement and i will work hard to keep my own opinion apply true.",6.5
69,Some people argue that space exploration has had more to do with national pride than international effort. To what extent do you agree with this? How do you think space exploration will change in the future?,"Since our old days, space exploration has always been considered to be a new way to communicate with the lives outside the Earth. However, its strong development in our society at the moment puts a question mark for the government as well as citizens, is that the purpose of space research is to contribute to a specific country or for a global effort. Personally, I would say that it meets the two aims rather than responses to one. 

On the one hand, there is no doubt that a successful space exploration mostly brings various achievements as well as compliments to a particular country. And that would be easily understood mainly because of the efforts that nations put into the project such as their own scientific research, their time spent through years to years, and so forth. In contrast, providing that the launch had not been fully accomplished or had unexpected trouble during the process affecting astronauts, they will take all the responsibility for their life.

On the other hand, I believe that every single success from any individual as well as their country at least contributes to the international effort. Despite the ongoing debate on the issue of whether or not to invest in this field to a great extent, there has been a dramatically increasing number of people who are joining space projects regardless of their diverse cultural backgrounds within different countries. To paraphrase, international bodies are  working together to achieve the same goal of conquering the universe. “That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind”-goes the saying of Neil Armstrong, who was the first human to land on the moon. Since many afterwards moon landings, space explorers have found evidence that Moon has integral factors supporting life and can be a potential new home for humans in the future. Furthermore, the development in researching space has become more widely extended than ever before with the adverse of newly-invented robots taking the main responsibility for collecting precise data. Intriguingly, space exploration now will be turned into tours that are open to every type of citizens.

All in all, there are lots of undeniable reasons why space projects are associated with not only national pride but also a global effort. What actually matters is the fact that not every nation would be good and fast enough to overcome an immense number of safe journeys into outer space. If nations don’t join hands to work it out, quite a lot of projects will be seriously stagnant,  leading to the late gaining benefits from the field.",6.5
70,"Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football, while other people think that taking part in individual sports is better, like tennis or swimming. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is considered that it is more useful to participate in team sports, like football, while other people think that taking part in personal sport is better, like tennis or swimming. While there are benefits to people who join in sports which are played in teams, I would argue that sole sport is a better option.

  On the one hand, the option to participate in team sports is attractive for several reasons. First, playing as a team promotes cooperation and good sportsmanship. In fact, no matter the individual talents of the players, the member learns to support each other through the game and must rely on their teammates in order to succeed. Furthermore, participating in a team sport can also be an amazing way to stay motivated and push up yourself. For example, having teammates to train with can be inspiring and encourage you to overcome weaknesses.

 On the other hand, I believe that individual sports such as tennis or swimming are beneficial in some ways. Firstly, people who join in sole sport are independent and do not depend on the others to get their own merits. Thus, they can find satisfaction in pushing themselves to achieve a personal goal rather than relying on the team to help them get there. Secondly, some individual sports allow flexible training times and personal regimens. For instance, athletes can focus on their own training needs; which means solving a personal weakness or improving their strengths.

 In conclusion, although both team sports and individual sports are profitable in their own ways, it seems to me that it is better for children to play individual sports.",8.5
71,"These days, too many people maintain their health by relying on doctors and medicine,rather than by following a healthy lifestyle. Do you agree or disagree?","The world we are living in at the present time provides us with numerous high-technology services, and that is one of the reasons why a large number of people are relying their health on medicine and doctors. However, I believe there is a significant quantity of citizens concerning with physical conditions and creating their own positive lifestyles.

For one thing, a healthy lifestyle including a healthy diet plays a more major part in a person's health than medicines or doctors. It is easy to observe a person working too hard and forgetting to take good care of their health. To paraphrase, we could easily recognize a youngster studying for their final exam who ignores his/her physical conditions. This is mainly because these nowadays technologies could provide us with as many as we need treatment for our health deterioration. Plus, it could include the reason of their young age, which means their physical as well as mental conditions are not damaged dramatically although they are consuming fast foods excessively or having an unhealthy sleeping routine. 

Without any doubt, there is still a large number of people around us are trying to follow a healthy lifestyle with healthy daily routines. They focus on their truly healthy diet that leads them to a positive life afterwards. Scientifically speaking, many physical activities like gym, swimming, basketball are necessary to burn off the calories of the body.  For instance, they try to do exercise every day so as to build a strong and fit body, as well as allow blood to flow fluently. Last but not least, getting enough sleep also greatly contributes to keeping fit and staying healthy. A healthy meal consisting of no oil and fat must be a need, it contributes to our efficient digestion. People following this type of lifestyle is having little chance of risking their health in trouble when they go into old age.

In conclusion, although many people are choosing unhealthy routines, there are a significant number of people maintain their health by building a healthy lifestyle. And in order to construct a community where health is considered to be the first priority, we need to erase our unhealthy life and change our health care way.",6.5
72,"In some countries, fast food restaurants and companies give money to schools provided that the school promote their products to school children.

What do you think is the positive and negative of this in the development of children?","These days, in some nations, fast food chains and corporations support schools financially to promote their goods to pupils. In my opinion, this has a plethora of negative and positive effects on school children. This essay will further elaborate on my visions with illustrations and a lucid conclusion in the forthcoming paragraphs.

To begin with, schools may afford their students' requirements by gaining money from these eating places and businesses. By receiving money, colleges are able to set up new facilities that students benefit from. For instance, my university's engineering department has an agreement with a cafe and this cafe makes a high profit by selling fast food. This is beneficial for both the university and the cafe. Secondly, the administration of schools would set up new facilities by using  financial aid so that teenagers use them. Additionally, giving an opportunity to choose restaurants the freedom to children makes them more confident. 

On the other hand, allowing these restaurants into schools may lead to diseases if they are unhealthy.

This is because fast food contains high sugar. Hence, this may result in heart diseases as well as obesity. For example, the latest study, conducted by researchers reveals that %67 juveniles eat fast foods at schools due to being easily accessible. Moreover, this research, surprisingly illustrates that more than half of the parents of these pupils permit their children to eat healthy nutrition rather than junk foods.

In conclusion, to recapitulate, the aforementioned arguments, It is acceptable that fast-food restaurants and brands aimed to sell their foods at schools because of their profits. However, authorities should make regulations and restrict fast foods in  schools due to their adversely impacts on children.",7

The two characteristics of automatic on our life are that it alter farming sector and auto industry.

 Farming development is one of technology charactersistics. Firstly, the automatic contribute in evolution farming sector,Meanwhile it helps farmers in pick up varieties vegetables in th filed, For illustrate there are a lot of farms using  a modern tractor in pick up an varieties crop.Morevere there are many compines depend on the robotics for working insted of workers ,so It can buy a robotis.

The other benfitis of auto industy is easier moving between contry, Because we can go to anywhere through car. in conclucion the car helps people in a lot of sides.

In the end, farming developments and auto modern are the two advantages of scientific evolution, although if the scientists don't invention things easer our life. we will find a diffcult situation.",5

77,What are the advantages and disadvantages of scientific research?,"It is apparent that scientific developments have dramatically changed beyond recognition. My perspective is that the merits outweigh the demerits. In this essay, I am going to examine both pros and cons in the forthcoming paragraphs.

On the one hand, there are numerous benefits to researching related science. Initially, scientific research has many subjects which have helped human beings in different ways. To illustrate, medical progress is a huge factor in continuing experiments in order to adapt to new diseases. Secondly, new methods for doing surgeries have been invented. For instance, some softly artificial plastic was used in nose surgery in the past by replacing a patient’s bone. Moreover, New vaccines have been investigated after finding some irregular infections. Consequently, the government should seriously consider taking an enormous budget for scientific study due to make them ultimately learn.

On the other hand, some scientific experiments might affect animals that are basically contributing to use for some facts. For instance, a mouse has always been researched as an experimental animal, although it could be successful, some experiments result in death or serious injury. Furthermore, the latest experimental about vaccines for COVID-19 play a vital role in creating the human immune. Unfortunately, some individuals die due to their bodies could not receive the vaccine effects. However, these vaccines can help million of populations on this planet to stay longer by ignoring COVID-19.

In conclusion, It is true to say that scientific research might offer many advantages in part of helping humans from harmful infection, but it also offers a few disadvantages with bringing death to experimental animals and humans also.",8.5
78,"Some people say History is one of the most important school subjects.Other people think that, in today's world, subjects like science and Techology are more important than History.
Discuss both views and give your opinion","Nowadays, the choice of subjects at the school level has become an issue of great concern all over the world. Some believe that departments related to history are essential for learning for students at schools, whereas others think that field of science is necessary in any case. This essay will explore why children must learn both disciplines for a flourishing society.

Studying science is of paramount importance because of several factors. Firstly, we are living in the digital age where technological innovation is a must without any doubt. It means that we are evolving gradually in every aspect of life so we need new technologies to become more advanced in fields of life. For instance, new diseases are spreading which require new medicines or vaccines to combat them. Thus, we need more scientists that could do more research in every required field. In addition, humans are exploring new worlds such as searching for life deep in the oceans and extra terrestrial spaces, therefore, we require intelligent scientific brains to carry out these missions.

However, some argue that learning history is also necessary for several benefits. One of the main reasons is that it is essential in terms of learning the origin and values of a particular region as it plays a significant role in the survival of any nation. Furthermore, studying  past events not only helps in increasing patriotism in residents of a particular country but also helps in learning about mistakes done by people in this past that results in destruction. For example, why did kingdoms and flourishing dynasties fall over time?

In conclusion, both types of subjects are the building blocks of any community so they must be taught at the secondary school level and students should choose both of these fields. In this way, we can progress further without losing our identity",7.5
79,"in the future,nobody will buy printed newspapers or books because they will be able to read everything online without paying.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Technology has been improving for decades.Consequently, books and journals have also been affected as much as other aspects of human life.Moreover, it is predicted that printed books and newspapers will not be used in future as a result of free and unlimited access to online reading websites.

As can be seen in developed countries, fewer people tend to buy magazines and newspapers from shops due to their horrendous impacts on nature.Furthermore,no trees will be cut if humans use less paper and  technology has made preserving the environment much easier.Besides, numerous articles and books can be found on different websites.

Another fact about online reading is that not only does it preserve the environment,but it also provides free books.Many people such as students and scientists used to buy lots of books related to their subject,locals would still wait for the latest in newspapers if they had no access to social media.As a result, people can spend their money on other things instead of buying books.

From my point of view, there is a spectacular amusing sense in reading paper books that would not be found in looking at your phone's screen,however,the access is limited and the cost is not free.

To sum up,despite the improvement of technology and its positive effect on books and magazines and the fact that we can find whatsoever to read with an easy search on our browser,I cannot deny the pleasure of buying books or looking for an article in streets.",5.5
80,"Nowadays, a growing number of people with health problems are trying alternative medicines and treatments instead of visiting their usual doctor. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?","In the modern era of times, a large number of the public who are suffering from diseases tend to experiment with other medications rather than consulting a family doctor. I believe this is a negative development because of two rock-solid reasons.

First of all, the behaviour of experimentation regarding healthcare could cause the health condition of a normal person more deteriorate instead of recovering. My point is that all sorts of treatment methods, such as ayurvedic, and so many others seem ineffective against some critical disorders, for instance, cancer, fatty liver, and so on even though they are appropriate for minor disorders. Therefore, a person who gets a serious health issue has a greater chance of death from using such medications.  

Secondly, the mentality of avoiding a scientific way of dealing with diseases could make people more unscientific which affects the logical development of society. This means when people start believing in medicines like herbal products, homoeopathy, and so many others that are not scientifically tested under laboratory conditions, they indirectly develop a sense of superstition among them about the effectiveness of mentioned medicinal products. As a result, the development of unworthy treatments gets more boost in the community and the logical one gets deprived. Therefore, the most effective healthcare industry, say, pharmaceutical falls, and in this way, it hampers the positive development of society. 

To sum up, it must be said that a significant number of people with health issues trying alternative ways of treatments and it could create a negative impact not only from an individual perspective but also from the standpoint of society. I reckon this is a negative development.",8
81,"These days, many people have their own computer and telephone, so it is quite easy for them to do their job at home.


Does working at home have more advantages or more disadvantages?","Nowadays, it is impossible to be completely apart from technology due to the pandemic. As a consequence, this has brought many people to work from home. Hence, I believe that the drawbacks overweight the advantages of this cause.

Certainly, the home office has become popular in our society over the last few years. Indeed, one of the most remarkable prose is the facility and comfortability that the home office can provide. One clear example is when I used to have virtual classes through a platform called ""Zoom"" during the pandemic. As a result, this had made it easier for me to get my assignments and projects done on time. Furthermore, I had more time to get prepared for my exams. 

Nevertheless, it should be considered that one of the biggest disadvantages is the negative impact related to social skills. The effects of spending a lot of time in front of a screen and also being isolated from the world can be incredibly damaging to mental health. For example, after spending a considerable amount of time with my computer due to my school and not being able to see my friends, I started to feel depressed and eager about everything. This made me realize that has to be a balance between having a social life and working at the same time in order to maintain good mental health.

To summarize, working from the comfort zone has its pros as well as cons. Meanwhile, the downsides overweight the benefits of the simple fact that affects social skills.",9
82,Some people think that television has made people’s life more interesting and beautiful. Do you agree or disagree?,"Due to technological development, some inventions have changed our life dramatically. TV is a typical example; it has made our life more interesting and beautiful. 

First, our knowledge can be enriched by watching TV. Take me as an example. I love watching animal channels; it teaches me a lot about the animals' habits; for example, I hadn't known that big white sharks were the food of killer whales. After I watched the documentary about marine life, I gained countless new knowledge. Besides, we can constantly stay informed by watching TV. There are many bombshells every day, and tv channels always report them; hence, TV is an essential way to convey information. 

Second, TV can entertain us. It's commonplace that people gathered together to watch something eye-catching, like some sports events or watching films on TV. At this point, TV can entertain our life to a large extent. It's worth mentioning that our vision has been broadened because of TV. In the past, there were only books; it was difficult to imagine the scenes in books. On account of the advent of TV, it realizes our imagination. For instance, it would be painstaking to imagine all the scenes in A Song of Ice and Fire. Nevertheless, because of TV, we can really see the mighty dragons and all the spectacles on the screen. 

On the other hand, TV has some disadvantages too. For example, it can adversely affect our eyesight. It has been reported that the global myopic rate is ascending substantially, and TV is considered one of the main causes. 

In conclusion, TV can satisfy and beauty our life considerably.",7
83,"Some think that young people should be free to choose any career they like, while others say that they should think more realistically about their future. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There is no shortage of opinions on the best way how to choose your career. Some people might think that it is better to follow their parents' path, meanwhile, others will try something cardinally new. If I were forced to choose, I would definitely opt for choosing whatever job you want. But anyway, this topic has some pros and cons, and I will develop these ideas in the subsequent paragraphs.

First and foremost, the main reason in favour of the freedom to choose any career is the common statement that you must like what you do. Moreover, many people truly believe that only with this approach you can rapidly reach your goals and become successful. Usually, you spend at least 8 hours per day at work, therefore that's the reasonable point. For instance, my friend Alex works as a producer of bloggers, which sounds really unusual. His main goals are preparing web courses and selling them through social media. To clarify, he is only 20 but already earned enough equity to buy a brand new car. It is certainly clear to see that the profession Alex selected is pretty new, hence there are not a lot of competitors and you can easily achieve a higher level of life than working at the regular job.

On the other hand, however, thinking more realistically about the future can also be the point, mainly because this is the way how our parents grew up. Generally, there was one way how to succeed in life: firstly you graduate from the university, then apply for a job at the factory or as a civil servant, and in 20 years you earn enough money to buy a house or a car. For example, my grandmother went through exactly the same path. Nonetheless, she says that she could always predict what would happen and don't take unnecessary risks. For this reason, I can also agree with my grandmother and understand her point of view that you should think thoughtfully about your future career and what hidden risks are included.

To sum up, in the light of all the above-mentioned reasons, I want to emphasize that indeed choosing your career path requires some mindful process, but you should be able to take risks because you live only once.",6.5

This kind of personality is commonly found in people like entrepreneurs. They always make adjustments and try new things with the expectation of having a better outcome. If there is a more efficient way to their goal, they will take it that way without hesitation. Those people are also fond of learning new things, setting consecutive goals and challenging themselves about their abilities. They take changes as positive things, and thus, they have no fear of negative impacts caused by changes.

In conclusion, different people have different perspectives about changes, but, we all should calculate the risk we are going to take for any action. In my opinion, a life without excitement is boring, but we should only do major changing decisions wisely.",6.5
90,"Some people think that it is good for a country's culture to import foreign movies
and TV programmes. Others think that it is better to produce these locally. Discuss both views and give your opinion","People have a unique view of their own and opinion by emotion and feeling about different type of movies and TV programmes being shown outside or not.Today, i will discuss about the two sides apply to the situation we are having here.

The advantage of watching your favorite entertainment outside is very convenient for a lot of peoples because they can have a better safe of time in their own life without interupted with another work.Secondly, people can always keep on track of the news happening a lot nowaday like accident, world cup or comedy show.thirdly, it is beneficial to believe entertainment being lives to the whole world can increase the popularity of one to another, the quality of the product, the trust of the user.

On the other hand, I strongly believe that nothing in this world is only a benefit without a single disadvantage.Like people with a personality is caring for the tradition only want their own product in their country to be a live legend in their own without the knowledge of the people outside.For example, Donald Trump is being renowned as a traditional person who wants only the product of his country to his without the need ofor other things.

To summarise, the main point is showing the outside the entertainment of the country have benefit and disadvantage.I mostly want to believe that movies and TV should show and spread around the world.",5
91,It will be better for society and individuals if driverless cars are widely used. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement？,"Driverless cars are becoming a reality thanks to technological advancements. It is argued that, whether wide use of them will be more beneficial to both people and the community or not. I am of the opinion that, driverless vehicles would bring a variety of advantages including efficiency and safety. 

Firstly, a vast majority of commuters complain about the wasted time while they are driving. Thanks to new technology drivers will be able to allocate their time to activities they want to do, for instance, fulfilment of duty, reading a book/paper, or watching a film/video. According to the news, I have read recently, people who prefer public transport rather than personal vehicles feel far more efficient and satisfied. It is simply because they spend their time ranging from checking e-mails to listening to podcasts instead of driving.

Additionally, the way of behaving people causes traffic congestion and moreover traffic accidents which may end with death. In other words, especially in major cities, commuting travel would last about three times more than expected because of traffic jams, and getting stuck in traffic puts a strain on people which in turn leads to road rage incidents.  According to a global organisation, it is estimated that more than a billion people die each year as a result of road rage incidents. It is obvious that self-driving cars will prevent such problems and guarantee a more peaceful environment on the roads. 

In conclusion, there is a dilemma regarding cars without drivers. Even though, taxi drivers will lose their jobs advantages of driverless cars outweigh the disadvantages because of the convenience of travel and life safety.",9
92,Today's young generation is facing many problems in school and at home. What are the problems? What can parents do to help their teenage children?,"There has been a controversy about whether young people have more problems in school and at home than before. I think this statement is correct, and my reasons will be explained in the following paragraphs.

First, the competition is more fierce nowadays. Take China as an example. Because China is at a stage of development bottleneck; therefore, young people vie with one another for a suitable job. Nevertheless, this pursuit is arduous to achieve; as a result, the unemployment rate is increasing rapidly in China. As a by-product of fierce competition in the job market, students have to face a sizeable portion of pressure. Parents know that a good diploma can help to find a well-paid job easier; hence, children need to compete with their classmates in school, and it's commonplace that children go to cram school to improve their grades so they have a better chance to stand out from this competition. 

Second, the internet brings anxiety to our life. For instance, you can always see more ""prominent"" people post some achievements about their family or children on social media. When parents see those pictures, they may feel envied, and they are stimulated to force their kids to do more work. As a consequence, today's young generation is facing more problems at home. 

Third, the government is influential in this phenomenon. One of the main causes of why the young generation has more issues in school and at home is that the number of schools is limited, and not everyone has the opportunity to study in a great school. At this point, kids have to study harder and harder so as to increase their opportunities to go to a top university. 

In conclusion, there are many other reasons, but those are the three main reasons.",7
93,"Some people think that children can learn about history by visiting museums, while others feel that there are better ways to learn about history.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","History is considered  the regular curriculum in every school from primary school to high school. Learning about the past, some people reckon that  museums are  promising places, whereas others argue that there are more feasible methods to teach children about historical subjects. In this essay, both statements will be presented before my opinion to support the latter view is  reached. 

On the one hand, it is apparent that the museum is an effective premise to educate children about the important events in the past, apart from ordinary classrooms as it can raise the interest of kids by telling stories through colourful boards and presenting real ancient stuff. For example, at the Van Koh Museum, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, the real pictures painted by Van Koh during 1860 - 1890 are shown in the gallery, which made me impressed and interested in the story of his life through his pictures and audio presentation. Therefore, the museum plays a key role in educating  history. 

On the other hand, there are various successful ways to learn it. One of them is watching movies and discovering. As movies are created for entertaining people, some   historical movies can provide both entertainment and knowledge. To illustrate, I still remember the story of Suriyothai, the Thai queen in 1700, who pretended as a warrior to fight with the enemy from Myanmar, although I watched it in the cinema when I was 6 years old. Moreover, without reading any books and visiting museums, I can learn  history by watching TV and video on the internet, which is very fascinating for me . 

In conclusion, according to the aforementioned reasons, the museum should be maintained and kept for the new generation who want to know more about  history. However, in my opinion, watching movies and series are more efficient techniques to educate kids about the major story of the past. Hence, the more entertaining media, the more attractive to young for learning.",8.5
94,"It is important for people to take risks, both in their professional lives and their personal lives.
Do you think the advantages of taking risks outweigh the disadvantages?","I believe that in everyone's lifetime have to face a choice which involves risks, but when they give their choices whatever to take risks or stay in comfort zones. It will come with plenty of benefits. However, there is a possibility that they could have downsides. In my opinion, the merits of taking chances outweigh the drawbacks. 

To begin with, by becoming risk-takers, they can get some negative outcomes, such as physical injuries or business losses. For example, extreme sports include high-risk activities like skydiving, rock climbing and so on. Although they can enjoy once-a-lifetime activities, they face injuries or even death. In business, high-risk investments will cause money loss or bankruptcy.  I don’t think that will be seen as a major disadvantage in life because I believe that everyone can totally successful and move towards their goals if they try hard. 

On the other hand, risk-taking will provide they more chances to sharpen and complete themselves. Because they grow through the process and become more resilient and confident. In addition, it builds those skills helps in taking more risks and improves the chances of achieving future goals. From a professional standpoint, taking risks can discover new and innovative new platforms or ways of working, thus improving productivity. Take Mark Zuckerberg as an example,  if he did not drop out of school to focus on Facebook, there would be another platform more well-known than Facebook. The risks may not give them positive outcomes but it gives you power and opportunities to brush up. 

In conclusion, while taking risks may produce unfortunate results in some cases, I believe the advantages usually far outweigh the disadvantages.",8
95,"Living in a country where you have to speak a foreign language can cause serious social problems as well as practical problems.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?
#country
#language","As we all know, living in a foreign country and dealing with new people is not plain sailing. Surviving in a place where a different language is spoken will not be easy even if you are fluent in that language. So, I agree that one has to face so many social problems as well as practical problems. In this essay, I will dig into some of the issues why it is not that simple to live in a foreign country.

    The very first thing one has to encounter is the language barrier. The different dialects will surely make you have trouble. Moreover, even buying things from a store will not be easy if you do not understand their accent. Another problem comes from communication with the local dwellers. For example, the local people invite you to a party but you cannot make new friends because of the language barrier while the others are having fun. Also, you will not get a chance to have conversations with your neighbours. Since you live in a new place you need to widen your social circle so you must be fluent in the language of the country that he intends to move to.

    In addition, coping with new cultures is another challenging thing. Every country has different religions and manners so we need to struggle a lot to fit in. If we cannot communicate, we will not get the opportunity to learn about their cultures and we will not settle in their community. The consequences of this are loneliness along with no friends and low socializing. For instance, when I travelled to Spain for business even though it was just a week, I felt so alone because I had no one to speak to or hang out with. I cannot imagine myself living there for extra weeks without even knowing a word. These are the detrimental effects of living in a country where you have to speak a foreign language.

    Taking everything into consideration, although we can not deny that there are so many problems in migrating to a different country, we can solve these problems with the help of language. Also, as time goes by we will be used to these problems.",8
97,"Although it is generally illegal, physical punishment continues in many countries. Some argue that parents should have the right to punish their children in this way.","Many people argue that corporal punishment can be useful for our children. Conversely, others think this path is obsoleted by experts. However, personally I completly dissagree with this idea that physical punishment is necessary for our children. But I would argue, I am a bit out of depth here because i am a single person.

First reason to disagree is that, by this method confidence is given from our child. As a result, they will not have active role in society. Inaddition, they would turn to an introverted person and will not have enough suitable result in their lives. For instant, if these persons will not control by parents and doctors, it ispossible become crimical. Furthermore, in the best situation, they will be given some disease like as depression.

Moreover, second reason that I am disagree is that, they should not be responsible about their responsibility. Physical punishment just turn our children to fighting with their future but in wrong way. Foe example, they want their right of others. whereas, oher children try reach their aims single handedly.

In conclusion, due to the reasons mentained above, I argue that we should have put corponal punishment away and alternative world-class methods to treat our children.",5
98,"Many people believe that funding space exploration is important. 
To what extent do you agree?","With the rise in global warming, life on earth is becoming endangered. Many are of the opinion that more funding should be given to exploring other planets where humans can live. I happen to agree with them.

To begin with, many people think that the earth will last forever, but this is not true. Like all things in our ,universe the earth will also end. Due to the fact that as the sun ages it emits more heat which will make life on earth impossible. For this ,reason we must explore other planets that humans can live on. For example, recent images from the Hubble space telescope revealed millions of galaxies which have human-friendly bodies of land. It would be wrong to not explore these options, as this can protect us from disaster.

Secondly, natural reserves of energy such as fossil fuels and coal are no longer able to keep up with the world's energy demands. Exploring space can help provide a solution to this. For example, recent images from ultrasound waves showed large reserves of methane gas on nearby planets which can last for  hundreds of years. So finding methods which would allow us to extract them would have great value.

To conclude, both the fact that the earth will not last and natural reserves of energy are decreasing  make valid arguments for funding methods to explore space.",6.5
99,"Many historical buildings are being destroyed or damaged, What are the reasons for this? What should be done to preserve these buildings?","In the past, cultures had a variety of historical buildings that left a unique signature to them. However, Currently, society started to be careless about their past. Therefore, they started destroying important buildings. In this essay, I will demonstrate the main reasons and alternatives that reduce this issue. 

Currently, some countries don't have enough free space to build stores and hospitals, so that resulted in destroying a variety of important places that means a lot to the culture. Also, when it comes to children, schools don't illustrate the idea of the importance of cultural histories properly, and it has led to negative outcomes for children. For instance, when it comes to asking young people about their background in history. The result is, that they're clueless about it. Moreover, it is clear that there is not enough awareness from many places including; education, parents, and the government. 

However, there are several alternative methods to prevent these important places. Firstly, Due to the lack of information in our society, there should be educational programs to develop better knowledge on how long it takes to build a cultural place to raise awareness. Also, we can create creative use to turn these places into museums which will attract tourists to increase their historical knowledge and values. 

To sum up, with the provided alternative methods we will prevent the problem of destroying buildings. Then, we will influence the next generation on how impactful these places have been to our world. I believe we will provide more energy and time to researching our historical past.",6.5
