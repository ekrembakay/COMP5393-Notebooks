Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?

In today’s modern world, money plays a major role in men’s lives. Some people think that the most important basic human’s needs such as food, clothing and housing can be solved by money. But I personally believe that in some cases, the acquisition of various sciences and human’s health, can’t be met through money.
It’s true that the study of science, like many other activities, is possible with money in the first place; but not all those who have an educational document are literate. Paying a large sum of money, some people are able to obtain a counterfeit document and they even think that they have achieved what they wanted with wealth. However, experience is not something that can be bought; Only with many studies and during many years, human beings achieve their desired knowledge and experience.
Before education, food, clothing, and material needs in general, men need health indeed. Only a healthy person can continue studying, working, and ultimately surviving. There are cases in which diseases afflict human beings at exorbitant costs, and those people who are unable to pay these costs say goodbye to life. But this is only one part of the story; there are other cases in which the disease is incurable. Take the present age as an example; human beings have been infected with an unknown virus that even so much wealth cannot save them.
Money is actually important; it has always been helping people in many ways. But it can never be considered the cure for all problems. It’s better to consider money as a complement to men’s health, prudence, knowledge and experience for a better life.
