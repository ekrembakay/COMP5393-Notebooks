Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?
#
There is a general belief, especially among poor people, that every problem can be met through money. It is true that the role of money in meeting some basic human needs is undeniable, but I personally believe that money is not the solution to all problems, because more fundamental problems such as diseases and emotion-related problems cannot be solved by money.
There are many incurable diseases that can never be cured, no matter how much money you have. For example, many genetic diseases; such as autism, many mental illnesses; such as schizophrenia, or some other diseases; such as cancer, have yet to be cured and even paying millions of money will not be able to save patients from death.
There are also various mental and emotional problems that money cannot solve. Take loneliness as an example; One can never get rid of loneliness or find true and everlasting friends for himself/herself with money. Some people also mistakenly believe that money brings happiness to them, but this kind of happiness, that comes with money, is transient and false and real happiness is never achieved with having more amount of money. Sadly, no amount of money can ever fix relations between people and emotional crises.
Money can sort out financial stresses a person may have, but it cannot buy a person happiness and solve all disease-related problems. It is just a tool which is used for living easier; so, money may lessen problems, but it does not solve all.
