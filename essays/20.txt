What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?
#
Studying at university is certainly fraught with problems that students have to deal with. Starting university is like starting a new life. There are various challenges that every student inevitably struggles with during university life, which most students are not prepared for and end up being overwhelmed. In my opinion, among all these problems, difficulty in social communicating and time management are common to all students.
The inability to communicate socially in a larger and newer environment than school can be the first problem which some students, especially freshmen and shy ones, face. Inability to find friends and communicate with classmates can lead to problems such as depression. For this reason, if a student takes the first step well, he/she can deal with some of the other problems more easily.
Inability to manage time and use it properly is the second problem that university students often face. For many, college courses require much more effort; from trying to study to living alone and doing the required chores, most of the students are not able to manage and think about their time and do not have enough concentration due to lack of sleep because they do not have enough time to do their activities. Proper planning is the most important action that a student can take to reduce irregularities. 
Naturally, every student faces difficulties in university life which he/she has to deal with in order to get through his/her studies well. If the student is sufficiently prepared and strong to face problems, he will not suffer from problems. But most students who do not have the ability to overcome the problems not only become depressed but also, they end up choosing to drop out of university.
