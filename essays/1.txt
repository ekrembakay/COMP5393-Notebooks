What kind of climate do you prefer to live in? Cold, warm, or temperate? Why?

Climate is one of the most important options which must be considered before choosing an environment for living. Itâ€™s because it can easily affect other environmental conditions. The question is what climate can be better for living. I personally prefer living in temperate climate. Such climatic condition brings pristine nature with excellent landscapes and consequently greater food diversity.Beautiful nature is a blessing that includes the people of temperate climates. Rain and fertile soil that pave the way for more plant growth are the benefits of this climate. Wherever the plants grow, fresh air is found too. Take the north of Iran as an example, there are plants everywhere because of the rain, summers are not too hot and winters are not too cold, and the climate is great for living in this area.As I mentioned before, the temperate climate has a great impact on the nature of an environment, and food comes from nature. Rich food in the temperate environment is obtained more and easier. Let's go back to the previous example; In addition to the unique nature, the cities of north of Iran have the most varied foods.Finally, it should be noted that what I have said are just two of the benefits of choosing a temperate climate for living.
