What kind of climate do you prefer to live in? Cold, warm, or temperate? Why?
#
Cold, warm, or temperate climate, it may happen you have experienced these climates in the different seasons. I prefer to live the cold weather because in the cold weather you burn more calories, it can alleviate you outdoor allergies, and it can strengthen your heart.
Burning more calories is the first advantage of living in the cold weather. When it is cold, your body works harder to maintain your core temperature. So your body use a considerable amount of energy to keep you warm, and humidify the air you breathe when you are out in the cold. Beside that cold weather can boost the metabolism of your body and can help you to increase the brown fat of your body which is the good fat. In fact, if you want to have a healthy body without any white fat, try to live in the cold weather.
The second advantage of living in the cold weather is that cold weather can alleviate outdoor allergies. Some allergies can decrease in the winter and also cold weather; allergies which are triggered by tree, grass, and flower. In the other words, if you suffer from outdoor allergies, living in the weather can be the best option for you.
Cold weather can strengthen your heart is the third reason for choosing this type of weather for living. In the cold weather, the heart works harder during periods of physical exertion to pump blood and maintain the bodyâ€™s temperature. Exercising outdoors in the winter makes heart muscles stronger. In brief cold weather makes your heart works harder to keep you warm. Your blood vessels constrict so the heart can concentrate on pumping blood.
All in all living, in the cold weather has some advantages such as burning more calories, cold weather can reduce your outdoor allergies, or it can strengthen you heart. Cold weather is a part of our everyday life.
