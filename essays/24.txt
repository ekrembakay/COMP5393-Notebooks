It is not worth going to university anymore. Do you agree or disagree? Why?
#
Choosing whether or not to go to university is a massive decision. It can have a huge impact on a person’s life, because one has to live with the consequences of this important decision for the rest of his/her life. Nowadays, many people accept university education, because they believe that it is an important part of becoming wealthy and successful. There are so many potential benefits that come with a college education. I, personally, believe that the most important benefits of going to university are job prospects as well as an effective development of social relations.
Having a higher education degree provides people more job prospects. Those, who have the degree, are more likely to find the job they are looking for and thus grow their economy and earn money. Employers may assume a person is better qualified for higher-paying jobs if he/she has a degree even if the degree is not related to what he/she has be doing on the job. On average, people with college degrees make more than people without college degrees.
University is not all about the job prospects, it is also a golden opportunity to meet new people. Being on campus, exposes people to different perspectives and ideas, and meeting people with different backgrounds and perspectives results in greater open-mindedness and a more worldview. What is special about a college environment is that you’re living with hundreds or even thousands of people who are around your age, probably for the first and only time in your life.
Overall, there are so many potential benefits that come with a university education. University can be very essential towards life, because it can provide job security, better career opportunities and a stable future. It also gives people the opportunity to develop their personal and professional interests. Many students head off to school with no idea what they want to do with their lives; University gives them a chance to try out different fields. Some people even believe that it can provide the life that many people wish and dream of achieving.
