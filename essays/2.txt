What kind of climate do you prefer to live in? Cold, warm, or temperate? Why?

Climate is one of the most important options which must be considered beforechoosing an environment for living. Because not only does it affect otherenvironmental conditions, but also the mood of the inhabitants of a region. Thequestion is which climate can be better for living. I personally prefer living intemperate climate. Such climatic condition brings pristine nature with excellentlandscapes, pleasant weather and consequently greater food diversity. It is worthmentioning that the inhabitants of temperate regions are warm and friendly.Beautiful nature and nice weather are the blessings that include the people oftemperate climates. A temperate climate has the four distinct seasons: Warmsummer, cold winter, autumn and spring. Rain and fertile soil, that pave the way formore plant growth, are the benefits of this climate. Wherever the plants grow, freshair is found too. Take the north of Iran as an example, there are plants everywhere because of the rain, summers are not too hot and winters are not too cold, and theclimate is great for living in this region.As I mentioned before, the temperate climate has a great impact on the nature of anenvironment, and food comes from nature. Rich food in the temperate environmentis obtained more and easier. Letâ€™s go back to the previous example; In addition tothe unique nature, the cities in north of Iran have the most varied, fresh and deliciousfoods.After all, the weather affects inhabitants as much as it affects the environment.Residents of temperate regions are relatively happy, warm-hearted and friendly.They do not resemble the inhabitants of cold regions, who are generally sad andunfriendly, or the inhabitants of warm regions, who are quick-tempered.Finally, it should be noted that what I have mentioned are just some of the benefitsof choosing a temperate climate for living; this climate and its benefits can only bewell understood when we experience living in it and witness with our own eyes thebeauty of its nature, the diversity of its food and the intimacy of its residents.
