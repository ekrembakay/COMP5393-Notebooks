What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?
#
Studying at university will certainly be fraught with problems that students will have to deal with. In my opinion, conditions are naturally more difficult for those who study in a city other than their hometown. The most important problems of these students, in addition to the cost of education, are accommodation and homesickness.
Each student has to prepare relevant books to study in any field. Fortunately, nowadays, due to the development of technology and easier access to the Internet, students are able to purchase books for free or buy them at a lower price.
Students, who live in dormitories, have group life; some items such as bathroom and kitchen are shared between them, which makes it hard for some of these students to endure university life. In my opinion, living in dormitories is one of the main reasons which causes homesickness, boredom and unhappiness.
For students who have left their hometown to study, it is most of the times annoying to be away from their family and friends. Just as advances in technology have minimized the enormous cost of preparing books for students, so too have advances made it possible for them to communicate with families and friends more easily than before, which mostly relieves their homesickness.
University life has many problems that every student has to deal with in order to get through his/her studies well. If a student is not strong enough to cope with such living conditions, he/she can easily become exhausted and dropping out of university is the least of the consequences.
