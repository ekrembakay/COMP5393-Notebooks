It is possible to be single for all your life and be happy. We do not need to get married. Do you agree or disagree? Why?

As long as the world around us has become modern, people prefer not to get married and stay single all their lives.
Many years ago the main reason for marriage was the continuation of human’s generation. Today it’s not that important to have a heir. Maybe because of financial problems, people don’t have that much money to leave for the future! But time passed and by developing the knowledge, psychologists found out that if men and women live together, they can better solve their problems, feel less alone, and actually complete each other. This may be true, but in most lives the man has the power and the woman is a cook for the family or a nurse for the children.
These days people live alone and independent of their family, because this way they can be more free. And for filling their lonliness, some of them take care of a pet. Maybe they think keeping a pet costs them less than having a child!
I don’t agree with being single and keeping pets in order to escape from loneliness, but despite all the problems that I, as a woman, may face in my single life, I believe that marriage deprives humans’ freedom by making commitment; men and women are forced to give up their own purposes by working hard all the time in today’s society to stay alive.
