What kind of climate do you prefer to live in? Cold, warm, or temperate? Why?
#
On the earth, we have four seasons, and according to that we have experienceddifferent climate changes. For centuries people have been debating on which climateis better to live in, hot, cold, or temperate? I prefer to live in temperate climate. Inthis essay I will explain why I love living in not very cold and not very hot weather.Generally, living in the temperate climate will help improve your health.When the weather is perfect, it encourages you to go outside and enjoy the outdoors.People can do some hobbies such as hiking, and jogging when the weather iscomfortable all days of the year.Making a life in temperate climate will extend the life of our belongings,because of this I love the temperate climate and prefer to live in this type of weather.Perhaps the reason which temperate climate can extend the life of our belongings, isthat your vehicle will not be exposed to bitter cold temperatures, road salt and otherrust-causing elements. This means your car will the last year longer in a warmclimate.Basically, temperate climates are defined as an environment with moderatetemperature; based on this definition we can understand that in the temperate climatewe do not have very hot or very cold weather. So I think that there are no seriousdiseases in temperate weather. People, for example, who live in the hot weathersuffer from heatstroke, or people who live in the very cold weather without any sunradiations suffer from osteoporosis.In short, different seasons bring different experiences and such experience ischanging in the climate. Our life and also our health both influence and depend ondifferent climate. There are some benefits in temperate climate which make it thebest weather to live. Because of these advantages I prefer to live in the not very hotand not very cold weather.
