What are the characteristics of bad teachers?
#
We will hope that all teachers are excellent, and effective persons. Students have all experienced good and bad teachers. What qualities can consider a teacher ineffective or bad? I think bad teachers may have three characteristics; they lack of classroom management, lack of motivation skills, and also lack of professionalism.First, lack of classroom management is the probably the biggest failure of a bad teacher. When a teacher does not have the ability to control students in the classroom, he or she cannot create effective opportunities for transferring information students. Simply, if teachers cannot manage pupils in their classroom they will not be able to teach them effectively. In conclusion, classroom management plays an important role in teaching profession. Lack of classroom management skills influences teaching and learning.Second, bad teachers do not the abilities to create an environment which can motivate learners and as the consequence they demotivate their students. Sometimes it happens that children lose their motivation for learning because they do not receive any attentions from their teachers. In short, because the bad teachers lack the ability to encourage learners, they are known as ineffective educators.Third, lack of professionalism can quickly lead a teacherâ€™s dismissal. Teachers who are routinely absent or tardy are ineffective. They cannot do their job if they are not there to do it. Briefly, a professional behavior shows you take your responsibilities seriously. Failing to act professionally sets a bad example and may cause you to lose the trust and respect of students.To recapitulate, we as a student wishes that all teachers are perfect. But it happens that pupils have bad educators too. An unprofessional teacher who does nothave classroom management skills, ability to motivate, and lack professionalism can adversely affect the attitude of students toward learning and teaching.
