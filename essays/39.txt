What kind of climate do you prefer to live in? Cold, warm, or temperate? Why?

If I want to choose a climate for living in the place or in a city, I will choose a mild climate. I prefer mild climate because two reason bother me; very cold wheather and terrible hot wheather.
The places that is very cold isn’t suitable for living. one reason is that some people have their special body nature who can’t live in very cold wheather. another reason is that there are many country and many city wich has no advanced facilities in their aparments when the wheather become snowy and very cold; So it.....turn off the electricite , gas and water. another reason that I don’t choose very cold city is the people in very cold country are depressed because they see sun a little day in year.
Hot wheather isn’t good wheather for living. Some body because their body nature can’t live in that and they may become ill . in very hot weather we need advanced stuff for reducing the temperature of the atmosphere.
