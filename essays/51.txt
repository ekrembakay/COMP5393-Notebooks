It is possible to be single for all your life and be happy. We do not need to get married. Do you agree or disagree? Why?

Happiness is an emotional state characterized by feelings of joy, satisfaction, and fulfillment. While happiness different definitions, it is often describe as involving positive emotions and life satisfaction. Although it is possible to be single for all your life and be happy, I disagree with this sentence. I think with a good marriage which has some characteristics such as empathy, and forgiveness, you can be happy too.Basically, empathy is the ability to relate to how someone else is feeling – to be able to put yourself in their shoes. It is crucial for any marriage to survive with some weaknesses. When you understand your partner in difficult situations, for example, you feel his or her reactions too. Infact, by truly understanding another person, you can be happy.Another factor for being happy with marriage is forgiveness. Generally, forgiveness means you forgive your partner’s fault but not always. When you remember all mistakes in your life and always mention them, you inject bad feelings and also unhappiness emotions in your mind. In brief, by forgiveness in your life, you liberate yourself from any bad feelings.In conclusion, I think happiness may depend on someone else, or by doing or obtaining something. I think, we can be happy with marriage too. The only thing that you should to know is that you mature emotionally and physically before marriage.
