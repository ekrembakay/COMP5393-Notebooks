It is possible to be single for all your life and be happy. We do not need to get married. Do you agree or disagree? Why?

Happiness is an emotional state characterized by feelings of joy, satisfactionand also fulfillment. Happiness may become dependent on someone else, or by doingor obtaining something. But when you understand the definition of happiness clearlyand embody it, you make better decisions and consequently your life becomeenriched. Although it is possible to be single for all your life and be happy, I disagreewith this idea. I believe with a good marriage, which has some characteristics suchas empathy, forgiveness, trustfulness, and also respect, you can be happy and makea happy life.Empathy is the ability to relate to how someone else is feeling; in fact to beable to put yourself in their shoes. It is crucial for any marriage to survive with someweaknesses, as it is an essential part of truly understanding another person. Whenyou understand your partner in difficult situations, for example, you feel his or herreactions too. In a word, by truly understanding another person, you can be happyand enjoy your life.Another factor for being happy with marriage is forgiveness. Obviously,forgiveness means you forgive the fault s of your partner in the life but not always.When you look back and recall all mistakes in your life, you inject the bad feelingsand also unhappiness emotions in your mind. In brief, by forgiveness in your life,you liberate yourself form any bad feelings and bring joyfulness in your life.A further fact that I think with a good marriage we can be happy too istrustfulness. Basically, trust means you have a strong feeling and also belief inhonest of someone. I believe mutual connection can bring trust in your maternal life.Honest is the quality o always speaking the truth and being transparent in your wordsand actions. When you say what you want directly, you relaxed yourself in your lifeand make happy moments with your partner. In brief, honesty in a relationshipmeans always telling your partner the truth and being totally open with them.The final reason for being happy with marriage is respect. Respect means adeep understanding of thought, reactions, and opinions. By accepting that youmarried with person with all his or her weakness and strengths, you make respect inyour life. It is better to clarify your wants from your married life. In short, respectmeans you accept your partner and try to make your life based on admiration thatcan bring happiness.To recapitulate, it is possible to have the times when you are single, but withthe good marriage you can strength happiness too. Marriage means you accept yournew life with your partner and try to be happy.
