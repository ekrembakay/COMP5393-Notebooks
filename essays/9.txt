Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?
#
In today’s world, money plays an important role in human’s lives. Some people think that the most important basic human needs such as food, clothing and housing can be solved by money. But I believe that more major needs, such as human’s health and learning different sciences, cannot always be met through money.
Men really need health before education, food, clothing and material needs. Only a healthy person can continue studying, working and eventually surviving. Sometimes the cost of treating some diseases is so high that not everyone can afford it, so they suffer the disease and eventually die. But there are other cases in which the disease is incurable that not even great wealth can save human beings.
It’s true that studying, like many other things, in the first place is possible with money; but not all those who have an educational document are literate; some people are able to obtain a forged document by paying lots of money and believe that they have achieved what they wanted with wealth. However, experience is not something that can be bought, it’s gained during the time by studying a lot.
Money is important; it’s always been helping people in many ways, but it can never be considered the cure for all problems. It’s better to consider money as a help along with human’s health and experience.
