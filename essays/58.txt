Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?
#
Money is an extremely valuable and essential tool in our modern society. It isabsolutely important and will solve many problems that we have in our life. On theother hand, I think there are many things that are indispensable and play importantroles in our life such as happiness, forgiveness, and humanity.On one side of argument, there are people who believe that money has a majorrole to play in the life of human. Undoubtedly money is required to buy anything.You can buy luxury and also modern things which can bring comfortable life foryou. Thus, if you want a life of luxury, without money, it would be very difficult tolive a comfortable life and hence it is easy to understand why people work very hardthese days to earn money. This point of view about money which can solve all theproblems leads to only one conclusion that money is an extremely valuable tool inthe modern life. It is absolutely important and solve many problems and because ofthat people work hard for many hours to earn money for solving their problems andhave comfortable life.On the other side of the argument, some people believe that there are manythings which are the most important such as happiness, forgiveness, and alsohumanity. Having money is good but expecting that it can solve all the problems iscompletely wrong. I believe happiness and the ability of forgiveness are the mostimportant factors that can solve the problems and can make worth living. If you learnhow to be happy and also how to forgive others then you have achieved everythingin your life. If you are depressed and not balanced in your life, what is the use ofmillions in your bank account? Money cannot buy everlasting life. It cannot buy yougood health, a life of free disease such as cancer, heart disease, etc. It cannot alsobuy humanity, although in the modern life money means many things. When weunderstand the reason of creating human, we can conclude money is just one of thetools that will help human for having better life. In conclusion, in the modern societywith complex problems money and earning more is very important but it cannotsolve all problems. Money is good, but just ask yourself what other things can solveyour problems?To recapitulate, there many things in our life which are irreplaceable and youcannot exchange them with money. We live in a world that is surrounded by positivecharacteristics. Few of us think that money is everything and can solve all problems,but I personally believe money has a minor effect on our life.
