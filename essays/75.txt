Earth, our home, it is the third planet from the sun. It is the only planet which has desirable features for living of human; it has oxygen, ocean of water and of course climate change. It may happened that we have experienced different types of weather such as cold, hot or temperate. I prefer to live in the cold weather because cold weather can boost your heart and also it can lower risk of diseases and infections.First, when you are exercising in the cold weather, your heart works more to keep you warm. Working outside and exercising in the cold air is fun and also challenging. If you want to have a healthy heart and an amazing life, try to live in the cold climate. To summarize, living in the cold weather is a good option for having a heart which works properly.Second, although catching cold is still likely during cold weather, you are free from many diseases and virus that are common during warmer temperature. For example, mosquitos are known to carry a lot of diseases, but during winter they are hibernating. To sum up, although you have experienced some diseases such as catch cold or sore throat, you do not have serious diseases and infections.All in all, we live in the earth which is the third planet. It has desirable characteristics which one of them is different climates. Living in the cold weather is better than the others because it can help your heart works properly and it can lower risk of diseases and infections.
