It is not worth going to university anymore. Do you agree or disagree? Why?
#
Choosing whether or not to go to university is an important decision, andultimately it could boil down to one simple question: “Is it worth going touniversity?” I strongly disagree with the idea that going to university has no valueanymore for three main reasons. By going to university you can get more knowledgein a specific area, you can obtain valuable experiences, and also you can becomemore independent.The first reason for going to university is to enjoy higher education and togain knowledge in an area which is essential for future job. Earning a college degreeis the most common pathway to a better career. Aside from training you in an expertfiled, university trains you to think analytically, helps you to instill crucial sills likeorganization. In fact, university can help you acquire a range of knowledge in manysubjects, as well as advanced knowledge in the specific subjects.The second reason for going to university is that you get valuable experiencethrough the study. Going to university is very different from high school; it is justlie starting a new life in an environment. You will learn to adopt and takeresponsibility for everything you do. In brief, by attending university you haveexperienced a new life and prepare yourself for future responsibilities.Becoming more independent is the third reason for going to university.College work will challenge and inspire you. You will decide which extra-curricularactivities you will focus, and how much time you will give them. In fact, collegehelps students develop into mature, responsible and independent adults.All in all university has an important role in your life. University can shareknowledge in a special are, you can gain value experiences through university, oruniversity can make you an independent person.
