What are the characteristics of bad teachers?
#
Certainly, bad teachers can be one of the main reasons why students hate school. These kinds of teachers can make school such a frustrating, embarrassing and a bad experience. I, personally, believe that out of all the bad characteristics a teacher can have, lack of classroom management, knowledge and commitment are among the worst that deprive students of better learning conditions.
Class management can be the demise of any bad teacher no matter their intentions. If a teacher cannot control their students, they will not be able to teach them effectively. Being a good classroom manager starts on day one. A lack of classroom management is probably the single biggest downfall of a bad teacher.
Unfortunately, there are some teachers who do not know the content well enough to teach it. This is an area that could be overcome through preparation. All teachers should thoroughly prepare for any lesson before they teach it to make sure they understand what they are going to be teaching. Teachers will lose credibility with their students quickly if they do not know what they are teaching. 
Of all the bad characteristics a bad teacher may have, non-commitment seems to be the worst. Not being commitment, teachers spend the minimum amount of time necessary to do their job never arriving early or staying late. They do not challenge their students and there is no creativity in their teaching. This destructive characteristic can easily kill motivation in students.
There is no such thing as a perfect teacher, but since school is one of the most basic and important organs in which students spend most of their time, there is no doubt that teachers have a tremendous impact on them, so they must be experienced, committed, capable, and most importantly, love their job and their students.
