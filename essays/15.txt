What are the characteristics of bad teachers?
#
Bad teachers, for sure, are one of the main reasons why students hate school. These kinds of teachers often don’t have organization skills and class management and this way they turn school into a frustrating and embarrassing environment. In my opinion, the inability to communicate with students is another characteristic of bad teachers.
If a teacher doesn’t have the ability to teach, all he/she can do is reading from his/her pre-prepared notes without mastering it. This way, he/she isn’t even able to answer the students’ questions.
Class management is one of the most important factors that affects class order. If the teacher isn’t able to run the class, chaos will prevent him/her from teaching well. In such a case, the task of establishing classroom order falls to the students who are selected as the group leader by the teacher.
Communication is also essential. Bad teachers who aren’t able to establish friendly relation with students, create an unpleasant atmosphere for them. Not being able to establish an intimate relationship, the teacher can’t make a good impression on students and provide a suitable environment for better teaching; so even the smartest students won’t be able to learn subjects well.
School is one of the most important organs in which a person spends many hours of the day. Therefore, in the first place, teachers must have the ability of teaching and truly love their job and students in order to make school a good environment for education.
