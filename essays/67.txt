It is not worth going to university anymore. Do you agree or disagree? Why?
#
Choosing whether or not go to university is a massive decision, and ultimately it could down to one simple question; “Is it worth going to university?” I strongly disagree with the idea that going to university has no value anymore for two main reasons. By going to university you can get more knowledge in the specific area, and also you can get value experiences.The first reason for going to university is to get the higher education and to gain knowledge in an area which is essential for your future job. For example, a popular belief is that if you do not have a degree, or if you do not have specific knowledge and skill in the proper are, you will not receive proper job in the future. In short, people attend to university to study in specific area and as consequence they will find desirable job in the future.The second reason for going to university is that you get valuable experience through the study. Going to university is very different from high school; it is just like starting a new life in a new environment. You will learn adopt and take responsibility for everything to do. To sum up, by attending to university you have experienced a new life and prepare yourself for future responsibilities.All in all, apart from above reasons, people will find themselves many other good reasons why they should attend university. University can share knowledge in a special area, or university can make you a responsible person. Going to university is an important decision and in specific moment of our life, we have to make it.
