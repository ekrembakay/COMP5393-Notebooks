It is possible to be single for all your life and be happy. We do not need to get married. Do you agree or disagree? Why?

As long as the world around us has become modern, people prefer not to get married and stay single all over their lives.
Many years ago, the main reason for marriage was the continuation of human’s generation. Nowadays it’s not that important to have an heir; people don’t have that much money to leave for the future! The main obstacle is financial problems; house, a suitable job, food and clothing for children. It’s too hard to earn money for a daily normal life just for one person, let alone a family!
If we give up the financial problems and focus on the mental aspect of this issue, obviously we see that by developing the knowledge, psychologists found out that if men and women live together, they can better solve their problems, feel less alone, complete each other and actually live happily ever after. This may be true, but in most today’s lives, the man has the power and is the breadwinner of the house, but the woman is a cook for the family or a nurse for the children; an obedient for his husband! So, it’s clear that being single can bring a person, especially a woman, more happiness.
Even if cohabitation starts with love, but sometimes the financial and mental aspects outweigh the love.
There is also other reason because of which people prefer to be single; for example, these days, to feel more free, people live alone and independent of their family. On the other hand, for filling their loneliness, some of them take care of a pet. Maybe 
they think keeping a pet costs them less than having a child, or maybe they seem more modern and classier!
I don’t agree with being single and keeping pets in order to escape from loneliness, but despite all the problems that I, as a woman, may face in my single life, I believe that marriage deprives humans’ freedom by making commitment; men and women are forced to give up their own purposes by working hard all the time in today’s society to stay alive.
