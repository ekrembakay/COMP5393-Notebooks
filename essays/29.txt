What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?
#
While time spent at college is a happy experience for most, the university life is not without its rough patches. Starting university is like starting a new life. Everyoneâ€™s situation is unique, but there are a few problems that almost all college students deal with at least once during their time at university. In my opinion, homesickness, social problems and time management are among the most important sufferings of university life.
The first year of university is always extra hard and most students will at one point get homesick and depressed, especially those who attend a university far away from their hometown. Freshmen suffer more, as it is presumably their first year away from their home, family and friends.
If a student is lucky enough, he/she will make many new friends, because establishing connections and spending time with friends is important for building community. Otherwise, it will be more difficult for the student to go through the university period with all its other difficulties.
University is academically challenging. The courses require much more effort and planning than high school classes. Most students do not have enough time to manage their activities. They sleep erratically and do everything at the last minute; that is what leads them to an unhealthy and unplanned life.
University life has many problems that every student has to deal with in order to get through his/her studies well. If a student is not strong enough to cope with such living conditions, he/she can easily become exhausted, depressed and end up dropping out of university.
