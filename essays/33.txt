What kind of climate do you prefer to live in? Cold, warm, or temperate? Why?
#
Human live in the earth, as result they have experienced different climates such as: Cold, warm, or temperate. Although I was born in the cold weather, I prefer to live in warm, or it is better to say, I prefer to live in temperate weather. I have some reasons for my claim, such as : living in temperate climate can speed the working rate, or living in this type of weather is more healthy than the other ones. But we should not ignore some bad effects too.
There are some positive points in living in temperate climate. Because in this type of weather you do not have too warm or too cold days, you can properly in your workplace. Another positive point of temperate climate is that it does not have crucial diseases; for example living in warm climate can bring some disease for human such as dehydrate human’s body. Living in cold climate is the same, it can bring some sicknesses such as: catching cold, sore throat.
Although I prefer to live in temperate climate, there is negative point too. Living in temperate weather can bring some weakness for your body, or it is better to say it can reduce the working of the human’s organs, because these organs in human’s body need different temperatures.
In the conclusion, I prefer to live in the not very cold and not very warm weather. But first I should pay attention to the outcomes of this type weather and then chose the life style for it.
