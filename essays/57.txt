Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?
#
These days, peopleâ€™s life is more complex, hard, and there are some problemsin it. Besides this human try to work hard to earn more money. Although somepeople believe money can solve all problems in the life, I disagree with it.Having money is good but expecting that it can solve the all problem iscompletely wrong. I believe happiness and the ability of forgiveness are the morefactors that can solve the problems and can make worth living. If you learn how tobe happy and also how to forgive others then you have achieved everything in yourlife. If you are depressed and not balanced in your life, what is the use of millions inyour bank account? To conclude, money is good but it is not everything.In addition, money cannot solve all the problems of humanity. Although inthe modern life it means many things. When we understand the reason of creatinghuman, we can conclude money is one of the tools that will help human for havingbetter life.Similarly, money is an extremely valuable tool in the newest society. It isabsolutely important but it does not solve all of our problems. Money cannot buyyou everlasting life. It cannot buy you good health, a life of free of disease such ascancer, heart disease, etc.In conclusion, in the modern society with complex problems money plays animportant role but it cannot solve all problems. I would never say money is useless,just ask yourself, excepting money, what other things can solve your problems in thelife?
