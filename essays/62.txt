What are the characteristics of bad teachers?
#
We will hope that all teachers are excellent, and effective persons. Studentshave all experienced good and bad teachers. I think bad teacher may have somecharacteristics such as lack of classroom management, lack of professionalism, lacof content knowledge, and lack of commitment.First lack of classroom management is the probably the biggest failure of badteacher. When a teacher does not have the ability to control students in theclassroom, he or she cannot create effective opportunities for transferringinformation to students. Being a good classroom manager starts on day when you asa teacher sets the rules of classroom and then fallow them. In conclusion, classroommanagement plays an important role in teaching profession. If teacher cannotmanage pupils in the classroom, they will not able to teach them effectively.The second characteristic of a bad teacher is lack of professionalism.Ineffective teachers are often absent. They may fallow a bad way of dressinguniform, and also they use inappropriate language in their classroom. Briefly, aprofessional behavior shows you take your responsibilities seriously. Failing to actprofessionally sets a bad example and may cause you to lose the trust and respectsof students.The lack of content knowledge is the third characteristic of a bad teacher.There are some teachers who do not know the content well enough to teach it. Allteachers should prepare for any lesson before teaching. In brief teachers will losecredibility with their students quickly if they do not know what they are teaching,thus it is making them ineffective.The fourth characteristic of an ineffective teacher is lack of commitment. Badteacher often spend minimum amount of time necessary to do their job. They neverarrive soon or stay late. Bad teacher with lack of commitment, do not challengestudents. There is no creativity in their teaching. In summary, bad teachers who lackof commitment, do not take their job serious. They do not use any creativities in theirclassroom. If a teacher lacks the commitment, they may not be suited for profession.To recapitulate, we as students wish that all teachers are perfect. But ithappens that pupils have bad educators too. An unprofessional teacher who does nothave classroom management, professionalism, content knowledge, and commitmentcan adversely affect the attitude of students toward learning and teaching.
