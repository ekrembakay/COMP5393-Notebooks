I choose temperate climate for living in a place. Temperate climate has more advantages than other climate and cold and warm weather has many disadvantages that they are not exist in mild or temperate climate. Because of these reasons that I explain each of them, I prefer temperate climate.
There are numerous advantages for temperate climate. Countries with mild climate usually have four seasons and their beauties. People enjoy from watching the nature of the earth, for example: the spring’s flowers views the summer’s fruites, the fall’s colourfull trees view, fall’s rain and snowy wheather in winter. Another season’s beauties is existence of special and tasty fruits in every season severally, specially in summer such as water melon, peach, cheery, fig and so on; There are pomegranate, persimmon, and etc in fall and greengage, strawberry are spring popular friutes. If we have four season and temperate climate country , we will enjoy from some special sports which are in winter such as mountaineering, skiing and which are in summer such as swimming, fishing, and etc. Whatching and felling nature’s beauties in every season is a strong and good reason for living in temperate climate. 
Living in cold or warm climate have some problems and disadvantages that many people do not prefer to live in that. Some people have their special body nature who can not live in very cold or very warm weather because they may be sick. Catch cold in cold climate and heatstroke in very warm and sultry climate are very common. In very cold climate people usually are depressed and sad because the sun shines less and they usually have lack of vitamin D. The apartments should have advanced facilities for raising or reducing the temperature both in cold climate and warm climate, otherwise they usually worry about gas cut off and power outage. Totally very cold or very hot climate offend the citizens of the cities or the countries.
The mild and temperate climate is suitable for living in everywhere. In temperate climate, we do not have any speciall worry or fear about lack of some thing to survive; we can enjoy from season’s beauties. Altogether, I think mild climate has many advantages where is reasonable for living.
