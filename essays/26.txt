Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?
#
The power of money in solving important and fundamental problems of life is transient and permanent. There is a general belief, especially among poor people, that every problem can be solved by money. Having money is great; It is true that the role of it, in meeting some basic human needs is undeniable, but I personally believe that it is primitive and wrong to think that money is the solution to all problems, because there are some disease-related and emotion-based problems that cannot be met through money.
There are various incurable and sometimes fatal diseases, which unfortunately cannot be cured even by paying a large amount of money. Diseases such as diabetes, AIDS, some cancers, mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and genetic diseases such as Down syndrome and autism have yet to be cured. Many people, all over the world, suffer from such diseases, but money cannot save or cure them.
Not only physical illnesses but also many mental and emotional problems cannot be solved with money. For someone who feels lonely, money does not accompany or for those who suffer from depression, money does not bring happiness. There are those who got divorced and unfortunately no amount of money can ever fix relations between people. There are many mental and emotional problems that money can never solve.
Overall, Money is just a tool which is used for living and making things easier, however, in fact, it does not solve all problems. Money will sort out financial stresses a person may have, but obviously it cannot buy him/her happiness and will not sort out all emotional and pathological problems; definitely it cannot buy a person contentment with his/herself. So, money may lessen problems, but it does not solve all.
