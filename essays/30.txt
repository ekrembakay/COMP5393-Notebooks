What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?
#
While time spent at college is a happy experience for most, the university life is not without its rough patches. Everyone’s situation is unique, but there are various challenges that every student inevitably struggles with during university life. I believe that among all the problems, time management and pressures of studying are the most important sufferings that almost all students face.
Inability to manage time and use it properly is the first problem that university students often face. For many, college courses require much more effort; from trying to study to living alone and doing the required chores, most of the students are not able to manage and think about their time and do not have enough concentration due to lack of sleep because they do not have enough time to do their activities. Proper planning is the most important action that a student can take to reduce irregularities.
Yet another challenge university students may face is the pressure of academics. University curriculums are significantly harder as compared to other educational levels, the change of pattern in university academics can stress a lot of freshmen during their examinations. On top of it, the demands for good scores, parent’s expectations, strict university admissions, etc. only increase the challenges for students. These difficulties affect the academics of the students and act as a huge challenge in their progress.
Starting university is like starting a new life. Studying at university is certainly fraught with problems that students have to deal with in order to get through their studies well. If the student is sufficiently prepared and strong to face these problems, he/she will not suffer from them, but those who are not prepared for these challenges and do not have the ability to overcome the problems end up being overwhelmed and drop out of university.
