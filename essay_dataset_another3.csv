0,What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?," While time spent at college is a happy experience for most, the university life is not without its rough patches. Starting university is like starting a new life. Everyone’s situation is unique, but there are a few problems that almost all college students deal with at least once during their time at university. In my opinion, homesickness, social problems and time management are among the most important sufferings of university life. The first year of university is always extra hard and most students will at one point get homesick and depressed, especially those who attend a university far away from their hometown. Freshmen suffer more, as it is presumably their first year away from their home, family and friends. If a student is lucky enough, he/she will make many new friends, because establishing connections and spending time with friends is important for building community. Otherwise, it will be more difficult for the student to go through the university period with all its other difficulties. University is academically challenging. The courses require much more effort and planning than high school classes. Most students do not have enough time to manage their activities. They sleep erratically and do everything at the last minute; that is what leads them to an unhealthy and unplanned life. University life has many problems that every student has to deal with in order to get through his/her studies well. If a student is not strong enough to cope with such living conditions, he/she can easily become exhausted, depressed and end up dropping out of university.",7,7.5,7.5,7.5
1,What are the characteristics of bad teachers?," Bad teachers, for sure, are one of the main reasons why students hate school. These kinds of teachers often don’t have organization skills and class management and this way they turn school into a frustrating and embarrassing environment. In my opinion, the inability to communicate with students is another characteristic of bad teachers. If a teacher doesn’t have the ability to teach, all he/she can do is reading from his/her pre-prepared notes without mastering it. This way, he/she isn’t even able to answer the students’ questions. Class management is one of the most important factors that affects class order. If the teacher isn’t able to run the class, chaos will prevent him/her from teaching well. In such a case, the task of establishing classroom order falls to the students who are selected as the group leader by the teacher. Communication is also essential. Bad teachers who aren’t able to establish friendly relation with students, create an unpleasant atmosphere for them. Not being able to establish an intimate relationship, the teacher can’t make a good impression on students and provide a suitable environment for better teaching; so even the smartest students won’t be able to learn subjects well. School is one of the most important organs in which a person spends many hours of the day. Therefore, in the first place, teachers must have the ability of teaching and truly love their job and students in order to make school a good environment for education.",8,8,7.5,8
2,Topic," In some countries the average weight of people is increasing and their levels of health and fitness are decreasing. I think that the causes of these problems are due to unhealthy lifestyle and lack of exercise.  Nowadays people are getting more and more lazy. They want convenience in everything. When they come home from work they will have microwaved dinner of fast food so that they do not have to take the trouble to prepare a meal or wash up after dinner. The introduction of fast food is also the main cause of unhealthy living. People are opting a fast food restaurant meal rather than a simple home cooked meal. Yes, your burgers and pizza tasted better than a home cooked meal but think of all the calories you are swallowing. The oil they used to fry your fries. It is literally black. Eating too much fast food will also lead to health problems. Sugary drinks, chips, candies and chocolate are also some of the causes that contributes to unhealthy lifestyle. Heavy consumption can lead to weight gain and diabetes.  I think the main cause is the lack of exercise. As you grow older, your metabolism rate drops. Even if you are eating the same amount as before, you will still gain weight. The one and only solution to this is exercise. The recommended exercise per day is at least 30 minutes of brisk walking. This target can easily achieved id people do not drive to work. They can take a bus or a train and drip one stop earlier than walk to the office.  Every little bit counts. When you come home from work, you can play with your kids or bring the dog for a walk. Anything to get your attention away from the couch. More exercise will surpress your cravings for sugary stuffs.  People should balance their diet. For example, by eating more vegetables and fruits. Eat less meat and drink plenty of water throughout the day. Organize time with your family to take a walk outdoors to enjoy the sceneries rather than cooping yourself in the house. This is healthy living for the body, heart and soul. It is also less likely to fall sick if you do plenty of exercise as your body is strong enough to fight off illness and diseases.",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5
3,Topic," According to universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. Therefore, this essay will show some reasons of argument for and argument against. Firstly, I will discuss about two reasons of argument for to begin with universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject because it will be balance of idea while studying. In general, there usually are different ideas between man and woman. These lead to new ideas from different vision will happen. Another reason is it display that have equal of society not accept in each side. In addition, nowadays, the most societies become to accept ability of both in any way. Secondly, I will discuss about one reason of arguments against that is some subjects not suitable for each other, for example, some subjects of sports such as weight putting. It is not suitable for female because there are different of body between male and female. In conclusion, I agree with universities should accept equal numbers of male an female students in every subject. Moreover, it depen on what the subjects that the students want to study, they can choose by themselves because I believe that if the students like to study their subjects, they will do it well so that I strongly agree with this topic.",5,5,5,5
4,Topic," It is quite common these days for young people in many countries to have a break from studying after graduating from high school. This trend is not restricted to rich students who have the money to travel, but is also evident among poorer students who choose to work and become economically independent for a period of time.  The reasons for this trend may involve the recognition that a young adult who passes directly from school to university is rather restricted in terms of general knowledge and experience of the world. By contrast, those who have spent some time earning a living or traveling to other places have a broader view of life and better personal resources to draw on. They tend to be more independent, which is a very important factor in academic study and research, as well as giving them an advantage in terms of coping with the challenges of student life.  However, there are certainly dangers in taking time off at that important age. Young adults may end up never returning to their studies or finding it difficult to readapt to an academic environment. They may think that it is better to continue in a particular job, or to do something completely different from a university course. But overall, I think this is less likely today, when academic qualifications are essential for getting a reasonable career.  My view is that young people should be encouraged to broaden their horizons. That is the best way for them to get a clear perspective of what they are hoping to do with their lives and why. Students with such a perspective are usually the most effective and motivated ones and taking a year off may be the best way to gain this.",8,8,8,8
5,Topic," Today more people are travelling than ever before. The reasons for this increase are many and varied. On a simplistic level, there are larger numbers of means of transportation - there are more cars, buses and trains in operation. However, the sheer number of transportation means is not enough to explain this increase. The cost of travelling; even though it is at present increasing due to an economic slow down globally; is still relatively affordable to many people. This affordability is further enhanced by the use of credit cards and loans in order to fund travel especially for holiday purposes. An increase of travel companies in competition with each other has also helped bring package prices down, while an increase in the number of operating flights globally has also increased, giving rise to falling air-fare prices. In addition, people now have more leisure time and disposable incomes. The combination of these two variables with unrelenting advertising campaigns from travel companies and cruise ship operators arguably leads to an increase in the number of people travelling, in this case for holiday purposes. Another reason why people travel is going to work. More than ever before, people are travelling greater distances to get to work. Large industrial sites for both service and production industries are tending to be located outside city areas. This invariably leads to increases in the number of people travelling locally. In conclusion, there are many reasons why more people are travelling both internationally and locally, for business and for leisure. What is sure is that this increase is likely to continue until travelling at current rates is no longer economically viable.",7,7,7,7
6,What are the characteristics of bad teachers?," Certainly, bad teachers can be one of the main reasons why students hate school. These kinds of teachers can make school such a frustrating, embarrassing and a bad experience. I, personally, believe that out of all the bad characteristics a teacher can have, lack of classroom management, knowledge and commitment are among the worst that deprive students of better learning conditions. Class management can be the demise of any bad teacher no matter their intentions. If a teacher cannot control their students, they will not be able to teach them effectively. Being a good classroom manager starts on day one. A lack of classroom management is probably the single biggest downfall of a bad teacher. Unfortunately, there are some teachers who do not know the content well enough to teach it. This is an area that could be overcome through preparation. All teachers should thoroughly prepare for any lesson before they teach it to make sure they understand what they are going to be teaching. Teachers will lose credibility with their students quickly if they do not know what they are teaching. Of all the bad characteristics a bad teacher may have, non-commitment seems to be the worst. Not being commitment, teachers spend the minimum amount of time necessary to do their job never arriving early or staying late. They do not challenge their students and there is no creativity in their teaching. This destructive characteristic can easily kill motivation in students. There is no such thing as a perfect teacher, but since school is one of the most basic and important organs in which students spend most of their time, there is no doubt that teachers have a tremendous impact on them, so they must be experienced, committed, capable, and most importantly, love their job and their students.",8,8.5,8.5,8.5
7,Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," The power of money in solving important and fundamental problems of life is transient and permanent. There is a general belief, especially among poor people, that every problem can be solved by money. Having money is great; It is true that the role of it, in meeting some basic human needs is undeniable, but I personally believe that it is primitive and wrong to think that money is the solution to all problems, because there are some disease-related and emotion-based problems that cannot be met through money. There are various incurable and sometimes fatal diseases, which unfortunately cannot be cured even by paying a large amount of money. Diseases such as diabetes, AIDS, some cancers, mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and genetic diseases such as Down syndrome and autism have yet to be cured. Many people, all over the world, suffer from such diseases, but money cannot save or cure them. Not only physical illnesses but also many mental and emotional problems cannot be solved with money. For someone who feels lonely, money does not accompany or for those who suffer from depression, money does not bring happiness. There are those who got divorced and unfortunately no amount of money can ever fix relations between people. There are many mental and emotional problems that money can never solve. Overall, Money is just a tool which is used for living and making things easier, however, in fact, it does not solve all problems. Money will sort out financial stresses a person may have, but obviously it cannot buy him/her happiness and will not sort out all emotional and pathological problems; definitely it cannot buy a person contentment with his/herself. So, money may lessen problems, but it does not solve all.",9,9,8.5,9

9,Topic," Today the way we consider human psychology and mental development is heavily influenced by the genetic sciences. We now understand the importance of inherited characteristics more than ever before. Yet we are still unable to decide whether an individual’s personality and development are more influenced by genetic factors (nature) or by the environment (nurture).  Research, relating to identical twins, has highlighted how significant inherited characteristics can be for an individual's life. But whether these characteristics are able to develop within the personality of an individual surely depends on whether the circumstances allow such a development. It seems that the experiences we have in life are so unpredictable and so powerful, that they can boost or over-ride other influences, and there seems to be plenty of research findings to confirm this.  My own view is that there is no one major influence in a person's life. Instead, the traits we inherit from our parents and the situation and experiences that we encounter in life are constantly interacting. It is the interaction of the two that shapes a person's personality and dictates how that personality develops. If this were not true, we would be able to predict the behavior and character of a person from the moment they were born.  In conclusion, I do not think that either nature or nurture is the major influence on a person, but that both have powerful effects. How these factors interact is still unknown today and they remain largely unpredictable in a person’s life.",8.5,8,8.5,8.5
10,Topic," It has been suggested that high school students should be involved in i unpaid community services as a compulsory part of high school programmes . /dost of the colleges are already prodding opportunities to gain work experience, however these are not compulsory. In my opinion, sending students to work in community services is a good idea as it can provide them with many lots of valuable skills.  Life skills are very important and by doing voluntary work, students can learn how to communicate with others and work in a team but also how to manage their time and improve their organisational skills. Nowadays, unfortunately, teenagers do not haue many after-school activities. After-school clubs are no longer that popular and students mostly go home and sit in front of the TV, browse internet or play video games.  By giving them compulsory work activities with charitable or community organisations, they will be encouraged to do something more creative. Skills gained through compulsory work will not only be an asset on their CV but also increase their employability. Students will also gain more respect towards work and money as they will realise that it is not that easy to earn them and hopefully will learn to spend them in a more practical way.  Healthy life balance and exercise are strongly promoted by the NHS, and therefore any kind of spare time charity work will prevent from sitting and doing nothing. It could also possibly reduce the crime level m the high school age group. If students have activities to do, they will not be bored and come up with silly ideas which can be dangerous for them or their surroundings .  In conclusion, I think this is a very good idea, and I hope this programme will be put into action for high schools/colleges shortly.",8,8,8,8
11,Topic," Traditionally, children have begun studying foreign languages at secondary school. But introducing them earlier is recommended by some educationalists. This policy has been adopted by some educational authorities or individual schools. with both positive and negative outcomes.  The obvious argument in its favour is that young children pick up languages much more easily than teenagers. Their brains are still programmed to acquire their mother tongue, which facilitates teaming another language, and unlike adolescents, they are not inhibited by self-consciousness.  The greater flexibility of the primary timetable allows for more frequent, shorter sessions and for a play-centered approach, thus maintaining learners enthusiasm and progress. Their command of the language in later life will benefit from this early exposure. while teaming other languages subsequently will be easier for them. They may also gain a better understanding of other cultures.  There are, however, some disadvantages. Primary school teachers are generalists, and may not have the necessary language skills themselves. If specialists have to be brought in to deliver these sessions, the flexibility referred to above ls diminished. If primary language leaching is not standardized, secondary schools could be laced with a great variety of levels in different languages within their intake, resulting in a classroom experience which undoes the earlier gains. There is no advantage it enthusiastic primary pupils become demotivated as soon as they change schools. However, these issues can be addressed strategically within the policy adopted.  Anything which encourages language teaming benefits society culturally and economically, and early exposure to language learning contributes to this. Young children’s innate abilities should be harnessed to make these benefits more achievable.",8.5,8.5,8.5,8.5
12,Topic," Nowadays, purpose of education being changed in Korea. There are some people who think that competition in children should be made, also others believe that children who are taught to co-operate as well as become more useful adults. There are advantages and disadvantages for both of the arguments. To being with, what is good if a sense of competition in children is made? They could develop themselves more and more as they learn and study a lot to win from the competition. To prove this, in Korea, it is popular – even common now – to have a tutor who come to student’s house to teach extra pieces of study with paying a lot of money. They learn faster than what they learn at school. Furthermore, during the vacations, students study abroad to learn English for a month instead of revise school work. If they have experiments such as study abroad, it is one of the greatest plus point to go to the famous well-known high school. Moreover, there are four big school exam and two national examinations to test students’ level of studies. Generally, only the highest 40% can go to the good quality highschools and colleges. Children learn as much as they can, to win the competition to obtain good quality schools. On the other hand, as they are busy to enter the school and study individually with their own tutors, there are problems. They become selfish. They become careless and don’t help others a lot if it is about studies. There will be no co-operations for them. Then, why are there companies for many people to work in? Each of them are clever, however, there are weak parts and strong parts for each person. To co-operate is to improve this part. People talk and listen to what other think of and learn. That could also be a great opportunity to learn instead of learning alone with one teacher. In conclusion, I strongly agree with that children should be taught to co-operate rather than compete. Nobody is perfect. People learn together, work together to develop each other. Therefore, I want parents and teachers to educate children concentrating on co-operation, no to compete and ranking them.",6,6,6,6
13,What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?," Studying at university will certainly be fraught with problems that students will have to deal with. In my opinion, conditions are naturally more difficult for those who study in a city other than their hometown. The most important problems of these students, in addition to the cost of education, are accommodation and homesickness. Each student has to prepare relevant books to study in any field. Fortunately, nowadays, due to the development of technology and easier access to the Internet, students are able to purchase books for free or buy them at a lower price. Students, who live in dormitories, have group life; some items such as bathroom and kitchen are shared between them, which makes it hard for some of these students to endure university life. In my opinion, living in dormitories is one of the main reasons which causes homesickness, boredom and unhappiness. For students who have left their hometown to study, it is most of the times annoying to be away from their family and friends. Just as advances in technology have minimized the enormous cost of preparing books for students, so too have advances made it possible for them to communicate with families and friends more easily than before, which mostly relieves their homesickness. University life has many problems that every student has to deal with in order to get through his/her studies well. If a student is not strong enough to cope with such living conditions, he/she can easily become exhausted and dropping out of university is the least of the consequences.",6,6.5,6.5,6.5

15,Topic," The relative importance of natural talent and training is a frequent topic of discussion when people try to explain different levels of ability in, for example, sport, art or music. Obviously, education systems are based on the belief that all children can effectively be taught to acquire different skills, including those associated with sport, art or music. So from our own school experience, we can find plenty of evidence to support the view that a child can acquire these skills with continued teaching and guided practice. However, some people believe that innate talent is what differentiates a person who has been trained to play a sport or an instrument, from those who become good players. In other words, there is more to the skill than a learned technique, and this extra talent cannot be taught, no matter how good the teacher or how frequently a child practices. I personally think that some people do have talents that are probably inherited via their genes. Such talents can give individuals a facility for certain skills that allow them to excel, while more hard-working students never manage to reach a comparable level. But, as with all questions of nature versus nurture, they are not mutually exclusive. Good musicians or artists and exceptional sports stars have probably succeeded because of both good training and natural talent. Without the natural talent, continuous training would be neither attractive nor productive, and without the training, the child would not learn how to exploit and develop their talent. In conclusion, I agree that any child can be taught particular skills, but to be really good in areas such as music, art or sport, then some natural talent is required",8,8,8,8
16,Topic," Nowadays the way people interact with each other has changed because of  technology. Yes, the technology has changed the peopled Interaction In very enhanced manner.  Earlier people use to walt and try to find easy way to contact their friends or relatives leaving far. In past there was no quick technology to contact or to establish any communication between one person to another person. The Drawback with past communication systems was that It were very slow and were time taking process such as telegrams, letter etc. People used to afraid to write their personal feedbacks or things to their love ones due to insecure medium of communication.

17,Topic," There is no doubt that traffic and pollution from vehicles have become huge problems, both in cities and on motorways everywhere. Solving these problems is likely to need more than a simple rise in the price of petrol. While it is undeniable that private car use is one of the main causes of the increase in traffic and pollution, higher fuel costs are unlikely to limit the number of drivers for long. As this policy would also affect the cost of public transport, it would be very unpopular with everyone who needs to travel on the roads. But there are various other measures that could be implemented that would have a huge effect on these problems. I think to tackle the problem of pollution, cleaner fuels need to be developed. The technology is already available to produce electric cars that would be both quieter and cleaner to use. Persuading manufacturers and travellers to adopt this new technology would be a more effective strategy for improving air quality, especially in cities. However, traffic congestion will not be solved by changing the type of private vehicle people can use. To do this, we need to improve the choice of public transport services available to travellers. For example, if sufficient sky trains and underground train systems were built and effectively maintained in our major cities, then traffic on the roads would be dramatically reduced. Long—distance train and coach services should be made attractive and affordable alternatives to driving your own car for long journeys. In conclusion, I think that long-term traffic and pollution reductions would depend on educating the public to use public transport more, and on governments using public money to construct and run efficient systems.",8.5,8,8,8
18,Topic," Fixing punishments for each type of crime has been a debateable issue. There are many arguments supporting both views, those for and those against fixed punishments.  On the one hand, fixed punishments will have a deterring effect on society. Individuals knowing that they will be subject to a certain punishment if they are convicted with a given crime, will reconsider committing this act in the first place.  This deterring effect also leads to social stability and security, through minimising the number of crimes committed.  If people knew they would be able to convince the court or the jury of a reason for having committed the crime they are accused of, penal decisions would be largely arbitrary. This would result into criminals getting away with their crimes and into a high level of injustice caused by the subjective approach of different courts.  On the other hand, taking the circumstances of a crime and its motivation into consideration is a prerequisite for establishing and ensuring justice and equity.  A person killing in self-defense cannot be compared to a serial killer, moving from one victim to the next. In my opinion an intermediary position between both solutions is the perfect way to establish and ensure justice and equity.  There have to be fixed punishments for all crimes. However, criminal laws have to provide for a minimum and a maximum for the punishment and the laws also have to foresee certain cases of exemptions.  An example for setting minimum and maximum penalties is Competition Law where a person being held liable of a crime under this law will be convicted to pay a fine, according to the harm caused by the violation and the profit gained by the violator through committing the crime.  As for the exemptions, in some countries the law exempts thiefs stealing food during a period of famine taking into consideration the distress and hunger.  Also, a person killing in self-defense will be exempted from punishment.",7.5,7.5,7.5,7.5
19,Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," In today’s modern world, money plays a major role in men’s lives. Some people think that the most important basic human’s needs such as food, clothing and housing can be solved by money. But I personally believe that in some cases, the acquisition of various sciences and human’s health, can’t be met through money. It’s true that the study of science, like many other activities, is possible with money in the first place; but not all those who have an educational document are literate. Paying a large sum of money, some people are able to obtain a counterfeit document and they even think that they have achieved what they wanted with wealth. However, experience is not something that can be bought; Only with many studies and during many years, human beings achieve their desired knowledge and experience. Before education, food, clothing, and material needs in general, men need health indeed. Only a healthy person can continue studying, working, and ultimately surviving. There are cases in which diseases afflict human beings at exorbitant costs, and those people who are unable to pay these costs say goodbye to life. But this is only one part of the story; there are other cases in which the disease is incurable. Take the present age as an example; human beings have been infected with an unknown virus that even so much wealth cannot save them. Money is actually important; it has always been helping people in many ways. But it can never be considered the cure for all problems. It’s better to consider money as a complement to men’s health, prudence, knowledge and experience for a better life.",8,8,7.5,8

21,"What kind of climate do you prefer to live in? Cold, warm, or temperate? Why?"," I choose temperate climate for living in a place. Temperate climate has more advantages than other climate and cold and warm weather has many disadvantages that they are not exist in mild or temperate climate. Because of these reasons that I explain each of them, I prefer temperate climate. There are numerous advantages for temperate climate. Countries with mild climate usually have four seasons and their beauties. People enjoy from watching the nature of the earth, for example: the spring’s flowers views the summer’s fruites, the fall’s colourfull trees view, fall’s rain and snowy wheather in winter. Another season’s beauties is existence of special and tasty fruits in every season severally, specially in summer such as water melon, peach, cheery, fig and so on; There are pomegranate, persimmon, and etc in fall and greengage, strawberry are spring popular friutes. If we have four season and temperate climate country , we will enjoy from some special sports which are in winter such as mountaineering, skiing and which are in summer such as swimming, fishing, and etc. Whatching and felling nature’s beauties in every season is a strong and good reason for living in temperate climate. Living in cold or warm climate have some problems and disadvantages that many people do not prefer to live in that. Some people have their special body nature who can not live in very cold or very warm weather because they may be sick. Catch cold in cold climate and heatstroke in very warm and sultry climate are very common. In very cold climate people usually are depressed and sad because the sun shines less and they usually have lack of vitamin D. The apartments should have advanced facilities for raising or reducing the temperature both in cold climate and warm climate, otherwise they usually worry about gas cut off and power outage. Totally very cold or very hot climate offend the citizens of the cities or the countries. The mild and temperate climate is suitable for living in everywhere.

Altogether, I think mild climate has many advantages where is reasonable for living.",7.5,7.5,7,7.5
22,Topic," I agree with the view that stars in the entertainment business are usually over paid. This is true whether we are considering stars of film, sport or popular music, and it often seems that the amount of money they are able to earn in a short time cannot possibly be justified by the amount of work they do.  However, it is also true that it is only those who reach the very top of their profession who can get these huge salaries. So the size of salary that stars expect is closely linked to the competition they have to overcome in order to reach success. They are, in effect, rare talents.  Furthermore, the majority of stars do not hold their top positions long. Sport stars and pop stars, for example, are soon replaced by the next younger more energetic, generation, while the good looks of most film stars quickly fade. So this relatively short working life may be some justification for the very high pay.  Unfortunately, professionals from other fields, who make a much greater contribution to human society, are paid so much less that it is hard to disagree with the statement. Teachers, nurses, laboratory researchers etc. are never listed among the best-paid professionals, yet they are more important to our well-being and our future than the stars who earn their fortunes so quickly.  In conclusion, I think there may be some reasons why entertainment stars earn high salaries but overall I agree that they are overpaid. The gaps between their earnings and those of people who work less selfishly for the good of society cannot be justified. Such professionals should be much better appreciated and better paid.",8.5,8,8.5,8.5
23,Topic," I think it is true that in almost every country today each household and family produces a large amount of waste every week. Most of this rubbish comes from the packaging from the things we buy, such as processed food. But even if we buy fresh food without packaging, we still produce rubbish from the plastic bags used everywhere to carry shopping home.  The reason why we have so much packaging is that we consume so much more on a daily basis than families did in the past. Convenience is also very important in modern life, so we buy packaging or canned food that can be transported from long distances and stored until we need it, first in the supermarket, and then at home.  However, I think the amount of waste produce is also a result of our tendency to use something once and throw it away. We forget that even the cheapest plastic bag has used up valuable resources and energy to produce. We also forget that it is a source of pollution and difficult to dispose of.  I think, therefore, that governments need to raise this awareness in the general public. Children can be educated about environmental issues at school, but adults need to take action. Governments can encourage such action by putting taxes on packaging, such as plastic bags, by providing recycling services and by thing households and shops that do not attempt to recycle their waste.  With the political will, such measures could really reduce the amount of rubbish we produce. Certainly nobody wants to see our resources used up and our planet poisoned by waste.",8,8,8,8
24,Topic," To a large extent, I believe that children are given too much free time. Free time in my opinion refers to time not spent under the direct supervision of a parent, teacher or a person entrusted with the responsibility of bringing up the child. Such time is often spent on several things such as watching television, playing with friends, going to parties, doing home work, playing games on their own among others. Among all of the above, a child could either be influenced by his or her peer group especially when left without attention or be influenced by what he or she watches on television most of which are those not meant to be viewed by the child's age group. In my opinion, most of the formative years of a child should be spent doing school work, engaging in recreational activities that would develop the child emotionally and mentally. I believe this strongly because at a young age, a child is quick to grasp most of all that is seen or heard. For instance, a child who is not used to doing more school work casually referred to as house work.",7,7,7,7
25,Topic," In big business cities there are two options available for the type of accommodation: houses and apartments. Some people prefere to live in apartments and some like to live in houses.  In big business cities, where almost everyone is going out daily for work or study, apartments provide a much more comfortable and safe way of living. The advantages include the fact that there is one key and Lock they have to take care of, and also the sense of being a part of a big family. Usually a guard sits at the main gate, so children can play around in the compound with their next door friends. In addition, not much daily cleaning is regained in apartments as no staircase has to be clean, which is a difficult task - all house wives know it very well. But a key advantage is that it is safe to go on voccation for a long trip.  On the other hand, houses have their own attraction for its inhabitants. Garden lovers usually prefere houses as they can have their own garden. It is also easy to keep a pet, especially a dog in a house because dog can play around the garden. If someone is interested in maintaing cars himself, it can only be possible in houses where one can have his own garage.  Where people are sometimes much more concerned about their privacy, Living in apartments can be a very difficult for them. It may also be the case that someone is not able to deal with other people, for instance next door neighboures, and than house can be a best choice for such people.  However, sometimes houses can be a bad choice for low income people. Maintaing a big house and running it properly can be a problem for such cases.  At the end I must say both options can be good or bad, depending on the personal considerations. But from my point of view, I must say apartments seem a gift of modern way of life which is not common in my home town.",7,7,7,7
26,"What kind of climate do you prefer to live in? Cold, warm, or temperate? Why?"," If I want to choose a climate for living in the place or in a city, I will choose a mild climate. I prefer mild climate because two reason bother me; very cold wheather and terrible hot wheather. The places that is very cold isn’t suitable for living. one reason is that some people have their special body nature who can’t live in very cold wheather. another reason is that there are many country and many city wich has no advanced facilities in their aparments when the wheather become snowy and very cold; So it.....turn off the electricite , gas and water. another reason that I don’t choose very cold city is the people in very cold country are depressed because they see sun a little day in year.

27,Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," In today’s world, money plays an important role in human’s lives. Some people think that the most important basic human needs such as food, clothing and housing can be solved by money. But I believe that more major needs, such as human’s health and learning different sciences, cannot always be met through money. Men really need health before education, food, clothing and material needs. Only a healthy person can continue studying, working and eventually surviving. Sometimes the cost of treating some diseases is so high that not everyone can afford it, so they suffer the disease and eventually die. But there are other cases in which the disease is incurable that not even great wealth can save human beings. It’s true that studying, like many other things, in the first place is possible with money; but not all those who have an educational document are literate; some people are able to obtain a forged document by paying lots of money and believe that they have achieved what they wanted with wealth. However, experience is not something that can be bought, it’s gained during the time by studying a lot. Money is important; it’s always been helping people in many ways, but it can never be considered the cure for all problems. It’s better to consider money as a help along with human’s health and experience.",8,7,7.5,7.5

I think bad teacher may have some characteristics such as lack of classroom management, lack of professionalism, lac of content knowledge, and lack of commitment. First lack of classroom management is the probably the biggest failure of bad teacher. When a teacher does not have the ability to control students in the classroom, he or she cannot create effective opportunities for transferring information to students. Being a good classroom manager starts on day when you as a teacher sets the rules of classroom and then fallow them. In conclusion, classroom management plays an important role in teaching profession. If teacher cannot manage pupils in the classroom, they will not able to teach them effectively. The second characteristic of a bad teacher is lack of professionalism. Ineffective teachers are often absent. They may fallow a bad way of dressing uniform, and also they use inappropriate language in their classroom. Briefly, a professional behavior shows you take your responsibilities seriously. Failing to act professionally sets a bad example and may cause you to lose the trust and respects of students. The lack of content knowledge is the third characteristic of a bad teacher. There are some teachers who do not know the content well enough to teach it. All teachers should prepare for any lesson before teaching. In brief teachers will lose credibility with their students quickly if they do not know what they are teaching, thus it is making them ineffective. The fourth characteristic of an ineffective teacher is lack of commitment. Bad teacher often spend minimum amount of time necessary to do their job. They never arrive soon or stay late. Bad teacher with lack of commitment, do not challenge students. There is no creativity in their teaching. In summary, bad teachers who lack of commitment, do not take their job serious.

It is the only planet which has desirable features for living of human; it has oxygen, ocean of water and of course climate change. It may happened that we have experienced different types of weather such as cold, hot or temperate. I prefer to live in the cold weather because cold weather can boost your heart and also it can lower risk of diseases and infections. First, when you are exercising in the cold weather, your heart works more to keep you warm. Working outside and exercising in the cold air is fun and also challenging. If you want to have a healthy heart and an amazing life, try to live in the cold climate. To summarize, living in the cold weather is a good option for having a heart which works properly. Second, although catching cold is still likely during cold weather, you are free from many diseases and virus that are common during warmer temperature. For example, mosquitos are known to carry a lot of diseases, but during winter they are hibernating.

35,It is not worth going to university anymore. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," Choosing whether or not to go to university is an important decision, and ultimately it could boil down to one simple question: “Is it worth going to university?” I strongly disagree with the idea that going to university has no value anymore for three main reasons. By going to university you can get more knowledge in a specific area, you can obtain valuable experiences, and also you can become more independent. The first reason for going to university is to enjoy higher education and to gain knowledge in an area which is essential for future job. Earning a college degree is the most common pathway to a better career. Aside from training you in an expert filed, university trains you to think analytically, helps you to instill crucial sills like organization. In fact, university can help you acquire a range of knowledge in many subjects, as well as advanced knowledge in the specific subjects. The second reason for going to university is that you get valuable experience through the study. Going to university is very different from high school; it is just lie starting a new life in an environment. You will learn to adopt and take responsibility for everything you do. In brief, by attending university you have experienced a new life and prepare yourself for future responsibilities. Becoming more independent is the third reason for going to university. College work will challenge and inspire you. You will decide which extra-curricular activities you will focus, and how much time you will give them. In fact, college helps students develop into mature, responsible and independent adults. All in all university has an important role in your life.

36,Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," Money is an extremely valuable and essential tool in our modern society. It is absolutely important and will solve many problems that we have in our life. On the other hand, I think there are many things that are indispensable and play important roles in our life such as happiness, forgiveness, and humanity. On one side of argument, there are people who believe that money has a major role to play in the life of human. Undoubtedly money is required to buy anything. You can buy luxury and also modern things which can bring comfortable life for you. Thus, if you want a life of luxury, without money, it would be very difficult to live a comfortable life and hence it is easy to understand why people work very hard these days to earn money. This point of view about money which can solve all the problems leads to only one conclusion that money is an extremely valuable tool in the modern life. It is absolutely important and solve many problems and because of that people work hard for many hours to earn money for solving their problems and have comfortable life. On the other side of the argument, some people believe that there are many things which are the most important such as happiness, forgiveness, and also humanity. Having money is good but expecting that it can solve all the problems is completely wrong. I believe happiness and the ability of forgiveness are the most important factors that can solve the problems and can make worth living. If you learn how to be happy and also how to forgive others then you have achieved everything in your life. If you are depressed and not balanced in your life, what is the use of millions in your bank account? Money cannot buy everlasting life. It cannot buy you good health, a life of free disease such as cancer, heart disease, etc. It cannot also buy humanity, although in the modern life money means many things. When we understand the reason of creating human, we can conclude money is just one of the tools that will help human for having better life. In conclusion, in the modern society with complex problems money and earning more is very important but it cannot solve all problems. Money is good, but just ask yourself what other things can solve your problems? To recapitulate, there many things in our life which are irreplaceable and you cannot exchange them with money. We live in a world that is surrounded by positive characteristics. Few of us think that money is everything and can solve all problems, but I personally believe money has a minor effect on our life.",6,6.5,6.5,6.5

43,It is possible to be single for all your life and be happy. We do not need to get married. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," As long as the world around us has become modern, people prefer not to get married and stay single all over their lives. Many years ago, the main reason for marriage was the continuation of human’s generation. Nowadays it’s not that important to have an heir; people don’t have that much money to leave for the future! The main obstacle is financial problems; house, a suitable job, food and clothing for children. It’s too hard to earn money for a daily normal life just for one person, let alone a family! If we give up the financial problems and focus on the mental aspect of this issue, obviously we see that by developing the knowledge, psychologists found out that if men and women live together, they can better solve their problems, feel less alone, complete each other and actually live happily ever after. This may be true, but in most today’s lives, the man has the power and is the breadwinner of the house, but the woman is a cook for the family or a nurse for the children; an obedient for his husband! So, it’s clear that being single can bring a person, especially a woman, more happiness. Even if cohabitation starts with love, but sometimes the financial and mental aspects outweigh the love. There is also other reason because of which people prefer to be single; for example, these days, to feel more free, people live alone and independent of their family. On the other hand, for filling their loneliness, some of them take care of a pet. Maybe they think keeping a pet costs them less than having a child, or maybe they seem more modern and classier! I don’t agree with being single and keeping pets in order to escape from loneliness, but despite all the problems that I, as a woman, may face in my single life, I believe that marriage deprives humans’ freedom by making commitment; men and women are forced to give up their own purposes by working hard all the time in today’s society to stay alive.",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

48,"What kind of climate do you prefer to live in? Cold, warm, or temperate? Why?"," Cold, warm, or temperate climate, it may happen you have experienced these climates in the different seasons. I prefer to live the cold weather because in the cold weather you burn more calories, it can alleviate you outdoor allergies, and it can strengthen your heart. Burning more calories is the first advantage of living in the cold weather. When it is cold, your body works harder to maintain your core temperature. So your body use a considerable amount of energy to keep you warm, and humidify the air you breathe when you are out in the cold. Beside that cold weather can boost the metabolism of your body and can help you to increase the brown fat of your body which is the good fat.

49,Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," Money is an extremely valuable and essential tool in our modern society. It is absolutely important and will solve many problems that we have in our life. On the other hand, I think there are many things that are indispensable and play important roles in our life such as happiness, forgiveness, and humanity. On one side of argument, there are people who believe that money has a major role to play in the life of human. Undoubtedly money is required to buy anything. You can buy luxury and also modern things which can bring comfortable life for you. Thus, if you want a life of luxury, without money, it would be very difficult to live a comfortable life and hence it is easy to understand why people work very hard these days to earn money. This point of view about money which can solve all the problems leads to only one conclusion that money is an extremely valuable tool in the modern life. It is absolutely important and solve many problems and because of that people work hard for many hours to earn money for solving their problems and have comfortable life. On the other side of the argument, some people believe that there are many things which are the most important such as happiness, forgiveness, and also humanity. Having money is good but expecting that it can solve all the problems is completely wrong.

50,"What kind of climate do you prefer to live in? Cold, warm, or temperate? Why?"," Climate is one of the most important options which must be considered before choosing an environment for living. Because not only does it affect other environmental conditions, but also the mood of the inhabitants of a region. The question is which climate can be better for living. I personally prefer living in temperate climate. Such climatic condition brings pristine nature with excellent landscapes, pleasant weather and consequently greater food diversity. It is worth mentioning that the inhabitants of temperate regions are warm and friendly. Beautiful nature and nice weather are the blessings that include the people of temperate climates. A temperate climate has the four distinct seasons: Warm summer, cold winter, autumn and spring. Rain and fertile soil, that pave the way for more plant growth, are the benefits of this climate. Wherever the plants grow, fresh air is found too. Take the north of Iran as an example, there are plants everywhere because of the rain, summers are not too hot and winters are not too cold, and the climate is great for living in this region. As I mentioned before, the temperate climate has a great impact on the nature of an environment, and food comes from nature. Rich food in the temperate environment is obtained more and easier. Let’s go back to the previous example; In addition to the unique nature, the cities in north of Iran have the most varied, fresh and delicious foods. After all, the weather affects inhabitants as much as it affects the environment. Residents of temperate regions are relatively happy, warm-hearted and friendly. They do not resemble the inhabitants of cold regions, who are generally sad and unfriendly, or the inhabitants of warm regions, who are quick-tempered. Finally, it should be noted that what I have mentioned are just some of the benefits of choosing a temperate climate for living; this climate and its benefits can only be well understood when we experience living in it and witness with our own eyes the beauty of its nature, the diversity of its food and the intimacy of its residents.",9,8.5,8.5,8.5

Why?," Choosing whether or not to go to university is an important decision, and ultimately it could boil down to one simple question: “Is it worth going to university?” I strongly disagree with the idea that going to university has no value anymore for three main reasons. By going to university you can get more knowledge in a specific area, you can obtain valuable experiences, and also you can become more independent. The first reason for going to university is to enjoy higher education and to gain knowledge in an area which is essential for future job. Earning a college degree is the most common pathway to a better career. Aside from training you in an expert filed, university trains you to think analytically, helps you to instill crucial sills like organization.

Going to university is very different from high school; it is just lie starting a new life in an environment. You will learn to adopt and take responsibility for everything you do. In brief, by attending university you have experienced a new life and prepare yourself for future responsibilities. Becoming more independent is the third reason for going to university. College work will challenge and inspire you. You will decide which extra-curricular activities you will focus, and how much time you will give them.

But when you understand the definition of happiness clearly and embody it, you make better decisions and consequently your life become enriched. Although it is possible to be single for all your life and be happy, I disagree with this idea. I believe with a good marriage, which has some characteristics such as empathy, forgiveness, trustfulness, and also respect, you can be happy and make a happy life. Empathy is the ability to relate to how someone else is feeling; in fact to be able to put yourself in their shoes. It is crucial for any marriage to survive with some weaknesses, as it is an essential part of truly understanding another person. When you understand your partner in difficult situations, for example, you feel his or her reactions too. In a word, by truly understanding another person, you can be happy and enjoy your life. Another factor for being happy with marriage is forgiveness. Obviously, forgiveness means you forgive the fault s of your partner in the life but not always. When you look back and recall all mistakes in your life, you inject the bad feelings and also unhappiness emotions in your mind. In brief, by forgiveness in your life, you liberate yourself form any bad feelings and bring joyfulness in your life. A further fact that I think with a good marriage we can be happy too is trustfulness. Basically, trust means you have a strong feeling and also belief in honest of someone. I believe mutual connection can bring trust in your maternal life. Honest is the quality o always speaking the truth and being transparent in your words and actions. When you say what you want directly, you relaxed yourself in your life and make happy moments with your partner. In brief, honesty in a relationship means always telling your partner the truth and being totally open with them. The final reason for being happy with marriage is respect. Respect means a deep understanding of thought, reactions, and opinions. By accepting that you married with person with all his or her weakness and strengths, you make respect in your life. It is better to clarify your wants from your married life. In short, respect means you accept your partner and try to make your life based on admiration that can bring happiness. To recapitulate, it is possible to have the times when you are single, but with the good marriage you can strength happiness too. Marriage means you accept your new life with your partner and try to be happy.",7,7,7,7

Take the north of Iran as an example, there are plants everywhere because of the rain, summers are not too hot and winters are not too cold, and the climate is great for living in this region. As I mentioned before, the temperate climate has a great impact on the nature of an environment, and food comes from nature. Rich food in the temperate environment is obtained more and easier. Let’s go back to the previous example; In addition to the unique nature, the cities in north of Iran have the most varied, fresh and delicious foods. After all, the weather affects inhabitants as much as it affects the environment. Residents of temperate regions are relatively happy, warm-hearted and friendly. They do not resemble the inhabitants of cold regions, who are generally sad and unfriendly, or the inhabitants of warm regions, who are quick-tempered. Finally, it should be noted that what I have mentioned are just some of the benefits of choosing a temperate climate for living; this climate and its benefits can only be well understood when we experience living in it and witness with our own eyes the beauty of its nature, the diversity of its food and the intimacy of its residents.",8,8.5,8,8
63,It is possible to be single for all your life and be happy. We do not need to get married. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," Happiness is an emotional state characterized by feelings of joy, satisfaction and also fulfillment. Happiness may become dependent on someone else, or by doing or obtaining something. But when you understand the definition of happiness clearly and embody it, you make better decisions and consequently your life become enriched. Although it is possible to be single for all your life and be happy, I disagree with this idea. I believe with a good marriage, which has some characteristics such as empathy, forgiveness, trustfulness, and also respect, you can be happy and make a happy life. Empathy is the ability to relate to how someone else is feeling; in fact to be able to put yourself in their shoes. It is crucial for any marriage to survive with some weaknesses, as it is an essential part of truly understanding another person. When you understand your partner in difficult situations, for example, you feel his or her reactions too. In a word, by truly understanding another person, you can be happy and enjoy your life. Another factor for being happy with marriage is forgiveness. Obviously, forgiveness means you forgive the fault s of your partner in the life but not always. When you look back and recall all mistakes in your life, you inject the bad feelings and also unhappiness emotions in your mind. In brief, by forgiveness in your life, you liberate yourself form any bad feelings and bring joyfulness in your life. A further fact that I think with a good marriage we can be happy too is trustfulness. Basically, trust means you have a strong feeling and also belief in honest of someone. I believe mutual connection can bring trust in your maternal life. Honest is the quality o always speaking the truth and being transparent in your words and actions. When you say what you want directly, you relaxed yourself in your life and make happy moments with your partner. In brief, honesty in a relationship means always telling your partner the truth and being totally open with them. The final reason for being happy with marriage is respect. Respect means a deep understanding of thought, reactions, and opinions. By accepting that you married with person with all his or her weakness and strengths, you make respect in your life. It is better to clarify your wants from your married life. In short, respect means you accept your partner and try to make your life based on admiration that can bring happiness. To recapitulate, it is possible to have the times when you are single, but with the good marriage you can strength happiness too. Marriage means you accept your new life with your partner and try to be happy.",6,6,6,6

66,"What kind of climate do you prefer to live in? Cold, warm, or temperate? Why?"," On the earth, we have four seasons, and according to that we have experienced different climate changes. For centuries people have been debating on which climate is better to live in, hot, cold, or temperate? I prefer to live in temperate climate. In this essay I will explain why I love living in not very cold and not very hot weather. Generally, living in the temperate climate will help improve your health. When the weather is perfect, it encourages you to go outside and enjoy the outdoors. People can do some hobbies such as hiking, and jogging when the weather is comfortable all days of the year. Making a life in temperate climate will extend the life of our belongings, because of this I love the temperate climate and prefer to live in this type of weather. Perhaps the reason which temperate climate can extend the life of our belongings, is that your vehicle will not be exposed to bitter cold temperatures, road salt and other rust-causing elements. This means your car will the last year longer in a warm climate. Basically, temperate climates are defined as an environment with moderate temperature; based on this definition we can understand that in the temperate climate we do not have very hot or very cold weather. So I think that there are no serious diseases in temperate weather. People, for example, who live in the hot weather suffer from heatstroke, or people who live in the very cold weather without any sun radiations suffer from osteoporosis. In short, different seasons bring different experiences and such experience is changing in the climate. Our life and also our health both influence and depend on different climate. There are some benefits in temperate climate which make it the best weather to live. Because of these advantages I prefer to live in the not very hot and not very cold weather.",6.5,7,7,7
67,What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?," Studying at university is certainly fraught with problems that students have to deal with. Starting university is like starting a new life. There are various challenges that every student inevitably struggles with during university life, which most students are not prepared for and end up being overwhelmed. In my opinion, among all these problems, difficulty in social communicating and time management are common to all students. The inability to communicate socially in a larger and newer environment than school can be the first problem which some students, especially freshmen and shy ones, face. Inability to find friends and communicate with classmates can lead to problems such as depression. For this reason, if a student takes the first step well, he/she can deal with some of the other problems more easily. Inability to manage time and use it properly is the second problem that university students often face. For many, college courses require much more effort; from trying to study to living alone and doing the required chores, most of the students are not able to manage and think about their time and do not have enough concentration due to lack of sleep because they do not have enough time to do their activities. Proper planning is the most important action that a student can take to reduce irregularities. Naturally, every student faces difficulties in university life which he/she has to deal with in order to get through his/her studies well. If the student is sufficiently prepared and strong to face problems, he will not suffer from problems. But most students who do not have the ability to overcome the problems not only become depressed but also, they end up choosing to drop out of university.",8.5,8.5,8.5,8.5
68,Topic," I am going to write about how the amount of crime is increasing in many countries and why. Nowdays there are many countries has increasing on the amount of crime and I think the problem is that most of the crim has done by the young people which is under 18 and from the age - you can see and you can understand what is going on but in my openion I think the main causes is the family and the school, the family I mean the mum an dad they have to look after theire tenagers until they grow up and do not let them watch films which has a fight or blod, the school is the same as the second house for the tenagers and they have to teach them how to grow up in good way and teach them how to respect the old people. For example I have been told from my oldest brother that in the UK 2 years ago a boy from Qatar he is 16 years old has killed bv groube of tenagers in Haisting and they killed him without any reasons and when the Police asked them why did you do that they said we want to show of we are the best. So you can say they learn from the action movies. Finally I hope all the people can help the tenagers to give them advice and to let them know what will happen after the crime. Also in schools they must teach them how to avoied the bad movies and to grow up in safe way.",5,5,5,5
69,Topic," What’s the happiest time in people’s lives: youth or old age; school, career or retirement? All of these have been suggested, but teenage years and adulthood both have many supporters. Those who believe teenagers are the happiest people cite their lack of responsibilities as a significant factor. They are supported financially and emotionally by their parents, and although they may be included in family decisions, they’re not ultimately responsible. However, adolescents are on the threshold of adult life: they’re old enough to get a part-time job, so they can enjoy their first taste of financial independence, and their future study and career lie ahead. Away from these serious concerns, young people have an active social life with their friends, often simply by hanging out with them. And of course, there’s the excitement of first love and first heartbreak. With all this to experience, teenagers see their parents’ lives as boring and stressful. However, the reverse is also true. Adults see anxious, self-dramatising adolescents, and appreciate the joys of maturity. These may include a contented family life, long-lasting friendships and a career. Long-term relationships may not have the fireworks of adolescence, but are stronger for it, because of the wealth of shared experience. At work, many of us are challenged and stimulated by the increasing professional skills we acquire, which ensures that our jobs remain interesting. The greatest benefit, though, is that maturity gives you greater confidence in your own judgement, in all areas of life. You’re not afraid to express your opinion when others disagree and, unlike a teenager, you know when to let things go. Both these periods can be happy times, but I look back at my own teenage years with no desire to go back. Adult life may be less dramatic, but fireworks don’t keep you warm.",9,9,9,9

Some people think that true function of universities provide knowledge for their own purpose, but nowadays. more and more people point out that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills according to the workplace.

Lastly, providing these knowledge and skills could benefit our country which usually gives a financial support to universities.

71,Topic," Nowadays many adults have full-time jobs and the proportion of their lives spent doing such jobs is very high. So feelings about one’s job must reflect how an individual feels about his or her life as a whole, and because of this, job satisfaction is indeed very important for the wellbeing of that person.  Employees get job satisfaction in a number of ways. Firstly, a person needs to feel that they are doing valued and valuable work, so positive feedback from superiors is very important in this respect. A sense of fulfilment is also encouraged if a worker feels the job is worth doing because it contributes to the society or the economy as a whole. Secondly, when someone feels they are improving or developing their skills through training opportunities, for example, then there is a sense of progression and purpose that rewards a worker. The sense of belonging to a team or a working community also contributes to job satisfaction because colleagues help each other to enjoy their working lives. Satisfaction is also increased by a sense of responsibility for and loyalty to a team.  Of course not everyone enjoys their work. Hard economic realities mean that many people have little choice in the kind of job they can get. In some cases an employee is working in a job that suits neither their skills nor their personality. Some jobs are repetitive and boring, and labour relations may be poor and lead to resentment and insecurity rather than to job satisfaction.  However, even though it is unlikely that all workers do feel happy in their work, I think it is not unrealistic to promote more job satisfaction in any job. If the factors identified above are implemented, then any job can be improved and more workers can feel greater degrees of job satisfaction.",8.5,8.5,8.5,8.5

Of course besides all the advanteges of being rich, loved and being famous there are many disadvantiges, that we have to take into consideration. So, alter all it is a guite hard question, and we cannot give an easy answer.  Let's just think of the celebrities, and try to get a few benefits of being well-known. Some of them had had a very long way until they reached their part of life when they are celebrities.  But if we just look into their everydays, we can say that they have a very good accommodation and lifestyle: they have an income of what everyone is dreaming, they live in huge houses, they can buy all the cars they want.  But as the saying says: ftioney is nothing, even they are rich, their persona! life is not always so beautiful as it seems. Let’s just remember the famous teenager singer Britney Spears. In the begining she was just like a young girl that everyone wanted to follow. But as time went on, she had some growing personal life problems. She was seen in nightclubs wearing the least dress, once she cut her hair bald, she had alcohol and drug problems. Anyway, being a celebrity is not often easy and beautiful!  Let's just mention the paparazzos. A celebrity cannot go outside his/her house to pick his/her morning newspaper without being photographed. They have to be very careful about their private life, because their fans are following them, and they always have to behehave perfectly! And since no one of us is perfect, their fans are gute often disappointed.

73,Topic," It is true that many parents purchase a multitude of playthings for their offspring. Whether or not this is a good thing for the child, is a moot point. On the face of it the advantages seem most apparent, but could there be a downside to this phenomenon of devoted parenting as well?  Most people would consider children who have many toys to be the fortunate ones. Interesting things to play with stimulate many positives in the young boy or girl, such as optimum brain development, hand-eye coordination and colour recognition, apart from the simple joy of playing. Modern toys are designed to be educational as well as fun, and concerned parents carefully select products which might speed their child’s acquisition of numbers or the alphabet.  Is it possible that owning multiple toys could be in any way detrimental to a child? This is an unusual question, but there are some hidden pitfalls. For one, wealthy parents might spoil their son or daughter by showering him/her with toys, resulting in a negative effect on the child’s character. For another, a growing child’s concentration span may suffer if they are constantly surrounded by too many tempting objects, so that they become unable to focus on any one game for a decent length of time before being distracted. On the social side, older children may become targets of envy from classmates, if they are perceived as having far more possessions than their peers. Finally, the majority of toys today are made of plastic which commonly contains the chemical BPA, proven to be dangerous for infants to suck on or ingest.  It is clear then that this situation is not as straightforward as it first appears. It would seem that one of the many duties of parents is to make an informed choice about how many toys they buy for their young ones.",8.5,8.5,9,8.5

78,Topic," One important stage in a child’s growth is certainly the development of a conscience, which is linked to the ability to tell right from wrong. This skill comes with time and good parenting, and my firm conviction is that punishment does not have much of a role to play in this. Therefore I have to disagree almost entirely with the given statement.  To some extent the question depends on the age of the child. To punish a very young child is both wrong and foolish, as an infant will not understand what is happening or why he or she is being punished. Once the age of reason is reached however, a child can be rewarded for good behaviour and discouraged from bad. This kind but firm approach will achieve more than harsh punishments, which might entail many negative consequences unintended by the parents.  To help a child learn the difference between right and wrong, teachers and parents should firstly provide good role modelling in their own behaviour. After that, if sanctions are needed, the punishment should not be of a physical nature, as that merely sends the message that it is acceptable for larger people to hit smaller ones - an outcome which may well result in the child starting to bully others. Nor should the punishment be in any way cruel.  Rather, teachers and parents can use a variety of methods to discipline their young charges, such as detention, withdrawal of privileges, and time-out. Making the punishment fit the crime is a useful notion, which would see children being made to pick up rubbish they have dropped, clean up graffiti they have drawn, or apologise to someone they have hurt. In these ways responsibility is developed in the child, which leads to much better future behaviour than does punishment.",8.5,8.5,8.5,8.5

Temperate climate has more advantages than other climate and cold and warm weather has many disadvantages that they are not exist in mild or temperate climate. Because of these reasons that I explain each of them, I prefer temperate climate. There are numerous advantages for temperate climate. Countries with mild climate usually have four seasons and their beauties. People enjoy from watching the nature of the earth, for example: the spring’s flowers views the summer’s fruites, the fall’s colourfull trees view, fall’s rain and snowy wheather in winter. Another season’s beauties is existence of special and tasty fruits in every season severally, specially in summer such as water melon, peach, cheery, fig and so on; There are pomegranate, persimmon, and etc in fall and greengage, strawberry are spring popular friutes. If we have four season and temperate climate country , we will enjoy from some special sports which are in winter such as mountaineering, skiing and which are in summer such as swimming, fishing, and etc. Whatching and felling nature’s beauties in every season is a strong and good reason for living in temperate climate. Living in cold or warm climate have some problems and disadvantages that many people do not prefer to live in that. Some people have their special body nature who can not live in very cold or very warm weather because they may be sick. Catch cold in cold climate and heatstroke in very warm and sultry climate are very common. In very cold climate people usually are depressed and sad because the sun shines less and they usually have lack of vitamin D. The apartments should have advanced facilities for raising or reducing the temperature both in cold climate and warm climate, otherwise they usually worry about gas cut off and power outage. Totally very cold or very hot climate offend the citizens of the cities or the countries. The mild and temperate climate is suitable for living in everywhere. In temperate climate, we do not have any speciall worry or fear about lack of some thing to survive; we can enjoy from season’s beauties. Altogether, I think mild climate has many advantages where is reasonable for living.",8,8,8,8

Nowadays, many people accept university education, because they believe that it is an important part of becoming wealthy and successful. There are so many potential benefits that come with a college education. I, personally, believe that the most important benefits of going to university are job prospects as well as an effective development of social relations. Having a higher education degree provides people more job prospects. Those, who have the degree, are more likely to find the job they are looking for and thus grow their economy and earn money. Employers may assume a person is better qualified for higher-paying jobs if he/she has a degree even if the degree is not related to what he/she has be doing on the job.

82,Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," The power of money in solving important and fundamental problems of life is transient and permanent. There is a general belief, especially among poor people, that every problem can be solved by money. Having money is great; It is true that the role of it, in meeting some basic human needs is undeniable, but I personally believe that it is primitive and wrong to think that money is the solution to all problems, because there are some disease-related and emotion-based problems that cannot be met through money. There are various incurable and sometimes fatal diseases, which unfortunately cannot be cured even by paying a large amount of money. Diseases such as diabetes, AIDS, some cancers, mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and genetic diseases such as Down syndrome and autism have yet to be cured. Many people, all over the world, suffer from such diseases, but money cannot save or cure them. Not only physical illnesses but also many mental and emotional problems cannot be solved with money. For someone who feels lonely, money does not accompany or for those who suffer from depression, money does not bring happiness. There are those who got divorced and unfortunately no amount of money can ever fix relations between people. There are many mental and emotional problems that money can never solve. Overall, Money is just a tool which is used for living and making things easier, however, in fact, it does not solve all problems. Money will sort out financial stresses a person may have, but obviously it cannot buy him/her happiness and will not sort out all emotional and pathological problems; definitely it cannot buy a person contentment with his/herself. So, money may lessen problems, but it does not solve all.",8.5,9,8.5,8.5
83,What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?," While time spent at college is a happy experience for most, the university life is not without its rough patches. Everyone’s situation is unique, but there are various challenges that every student inevitably struggles with during university life. I believe that among all the problems, time management and pressures of studying are the most important sufferings that almost all students face. Inability to manage time and use it properly is the first problem that university students often face. For many, college courses require much more effort; from trying to study to living alone and doing the required chores, most of the students are not able to manage and think about their time and do not have enough concentration due to lack of sleep because they do not have enough time to do their activities. Proper planning is the most important action that a student can take to reduce irregularities. Yet another challenge university students may face is the pressure of academics.

84,Topic," In recent years, government focuse on improving quality of life, that would bring a lot benefits for citizens. Such as, communication, transportation, health care. Some argument that built railways is more useful for local people than roads. In my opinion, it is good idea that more train station is built. There are some reasons.  First of all, it reduced pollution when more people give up driving to work in weekday. Nowadays, people spend a lot of time on the road in rush hours. At the same time, emissions of car bring a pollution in our enviroment. People easily get upset, if they got into traffic jam for longtime. Research has shown that it is get more pollution of air that car stoped on the road without cutting power. Train station is a good way to make easy that train never could get into congestion and train is a public transport which is more helpful to reduce air pollution.  Secondly, it solved congestion on the road while many people commute by train, nearly years, a number of car is growing. So, a question that a number of cars is over volume of road is following. This caused traffic jam have being horrible problem. However, the train will take more people to go to their destinations without waiting on road in rush hour. It is more convience for citizen.  Finally, taking public transport is cheaper than privatcal vichele. People could save money to do others they interested.  Overall, goverment pays more money for building railway. It brings more it is a good decision that advantages than drawbacks.",5.5,5.5,5.5,5.5
85,Topic," Nowadays, more than million tons of wastes have been being produced which from home everyday and some people claim that not enough of the litters is recycled. Therefore, they think the government should have a policy to increase recycling.  It is necessary to say that their governments should take action. For example, providing rubbish bag into each family so that separate a litter and make it to have value. Many waste, paper box or steel from home can sale to governments or decrease council tax. Either, the government should provide junk bank that the citizen can deposit recycled waste and inverse to be some money.  Moreover, the government should have spot advertisement on television to motivate advantages of recycling. In Thailand, my country, we have 3R advertisement standing for reuse, reduce, and recycle and easy example way to do in house such as using less plastics bag (reduce), reuse take away box or sale some paper.  In school teacher teach children how to recycle waste at home and go back to tell their parent and comeback to report their teacher. There is one day a week in order that clean school together which help they have a good attitude in cleaning.  In conclution, it should be good that government make some law about waste tax and make people follow the law by give them back some money. Starting give education at school so that when they growth up the will do easier.  In my opinion, it is very easy to government to do as I mention above to reduce waste from homes such as 3R, junk bank, providing rubbish bins and teaching at school and it will be a good habit and good in long term.",5,5,5,5

Although I was born in the cold weather, I prefer to live in warm, or it is better to say, I prefer to live in temperate weather. I have some reasons for my claim, such as : living in temperate climate can speed the working rate, or living in this type of weather is more healthy than the other ones. But we should not ignore some bad effects too. There are some positive points in living in temperate climate. Because in this type of weather you do not have too warm or too cold days, you can properly in your workplace. Another positive point of temperate climate is that it does not have crucial diseases; for example living in warm climate can bring some disease for human such as dehydrate human’s body. Living in cold climate is the same, it can bring some sicknesses such as: catching cold, sore throat. Although I prefer to live in temperate climate, there is negative point too. Living in temperate weather can bring some weakness for your body, or it is better to say it can reduce the working of the human’s organs, because these organs in human’s body need different temperatures. In the conclusion, I prefer to live in the not very cold and not very warm weather.

It is true that the role of money in meeting some basic human needs is undeniable, but I personally believe that money is not the solution to all problems, because more fundamental problems such as diseases and emotion-related problems cannot be solved by money. There are many incurable diseases that can never be cured, no matter how much money you have. For example, many genetic diseases; such as autism, many mental illnesses; such as schizophrenia, or some other diseases; such as cancer, have yet to be cured and even paying millions of money will not be able to save patients from death.

Take loneliness as an example; One can never get rid of loneliness or find true and everlasting friends for himself/herself with money.

88,What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?," While time spent at college is a happy experience for most, the university life is not without its rough patches. Starting university is like starting a new life. Everyone’s situation is unique, but there are a few problems that almost all college students deal with at least once during their time at university. In my opinion, homesickness, social problems and time management are among the most important sufferings of university life. The first year of university is always extra hard and most students will at one point get homesick and depressed, especially those who attend a university far away from their hometown. Freshmen suffer more, as it is presumably their first year away from their home, family and friends. If a student is lucky enough, he/she will make many new friends, because establishing connections and spending time with friends is important for building community. Otherwise, it will be more difficult for the student to go through the university period with all its other difficulties. University is academically challenging. The courses require much more effort and planning than high school classes. Most students do not have enough time to manage their activities. They sleep erratically and do everything at the last minute; that is what leads them to an unhealthy and unplanned life. University life has many problems that every student has to deal with in order to get through his/her studies well. If a student is not strong enough to cope with such living conditions, he/she can easily become exhausted, depressed and end up dropping out of university.",8.5,8.5,8.5,8.5

90,What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?," Studying at university will certainly be fraught with problems that students will have to deal with. In my opinion, conditions are naturally more difficult for those who study in a city other than their hometown. The most important problems of these students, in addition to the cost of education, are accommodation and homesickness. Each student has to prepare relevant books to study in any field. Fortunately, nowadays, due to the development of technology and easier access to the Internet, students are able to purchase books for free or buy them at a lower price. Students, who live in dormitories, have group life; some items such as bathroom and kitchen are shared between them, which makes it hard for some of these students to endure university life. In my opinion, living in dormitories is one of the main reasons which causes homesickness, boredom and unhappiness. For students who have left their hometown to study, it is most of the times annoying to be away from their family and friends. Just as advances in technology have minimized the enormous cost of preparing books for students, so too have advances made it possible for them to communicate with families and friends more easily than before, which mostly relieves their homesickness. University life has many problems that every student has to deal with in order to get through his/her studies well. If a student is not strong enough to cope with such living conditions, he/she can easily become exhausted and dropping out of university is the least of the consequences.",7.5,8,7.5,7.5
91,Topic," A problem of modern societies is the declining level of health in the general population, with conflicting views on how to tackle this worrying trend. One possible solution is to provide more sports facilities to encourage a more active lifestyle.  Advocates of this believe that today’s sedentary lifestyle and stressful working conditions mean that physical activity is no longer part of either our work or our leisure time. If there were easy-to-reach local sports centres, we would be more likely to make exercise a regular part of our lives, rather than just collapsing in front of a screen every evening. The variety of sports that could be offered would cater for all ages, levels of fitness and interests: those with painful memories of PE at school might be happier in the swimming pool than on the football pitch.  However, there may be better ways of tackling this problem. Interest in sport is not universal, and additional facilities might simply attract the already fit, not those who most need them. Physical activity could be encouraged relatively cheaply, for example by installing exercise equipment in parks, as my local council has done. This has the added benefit that parents and children often use them together just for fun, which develops a positive attitude to exercise at an early age.  As well as physical activity, high tax penalties could be imposed on high-fat food products, tobacco and alcohol, as excessive consumption of any of these contributes to poor health. Even improving public transport would help: it takes longer to walk to the bus stop than to the car.  In my opinion, focusing on sports facilities is too narrow an approach and would not have the desired results. People should be encouraged not only to be more physically active but also to adopt a healthier lifestyle in general.",6,6,6,6
92,Topic," Nowadays economic progress plays an important part in our life. So many governments believe that it should be the most important goal. But some people argue that it is not the most important thing. There are other progresses are equally important. In this essay, we are going to talking about why people have different views.  Generally people think money is everything, if we do not have any money, we can not buy anything. So the goverments put the economic progress to the top list. They believe that if the economic progress could bring a good result, then people can have money to raise satisfaction about their life. However, other types of progresses are not important.  Some people suggest that the government should not put the economic progress to the most important place. Because there are other progresses such as healthy system, building design, or education system are as same important as economic  for a country, even if it has a hot of money. In this modern society, more and more people realize that money is not the important thing in the world, and it does not mean anything, while they think health, happiness are more important than it. Owing to that, some people argue that other types of progresses are equally important.  From my point of view, I agree with that other types of progress are as important as economic. Even though we have a lot of money, we can not buy happiness and health. Therefore the governments should put other types of progresses to the important place as well.",5.5,5.5,5.5,5.5
93,Topic," It is said that countries are becoming similar to each other because of the global spread of the same products, which are now available for purchase almost anywhere. I strongly believe that this modern development is largely detrimental to culture and traditions worldwide.  A country’s history, language and ethos are all inextricably bound up in its manufactured artefacts. If the relentless advance of international brands into every corner of the world continues, these bland packages might one day completely oust the traditional objects of a nation, which would be a loss of richness and diversity in the world, as well as the sad disappearance of the manifestations of a place’s character What would a Japanese tea ceremony be without its specially crafted teapot, or a Fijian kava ritual without its bowl made from a certain type of tree bark?  Let us not forget either that traditional products, whether these be medicines, cosmetics, toys, clothes, utensils or food, provide employment for local people. The spread of multinational products can often bring in its wake a loss of jobs, as people turn to buying the new brand, perhaps thinking it more glamorous than the one they are used to. This eventually puts old-school craftspeople out of work.  Finally, tourism numbers may also be affected, as travellers become disillusioned with finding every place just the same as the one they visited previously. To see the same products in shops the world over is boring, and does not impel visitors to open their wallets in the same way that trinkets or souvenirs unique to the particular area do.  Some may argue that all people are entitled to have access to the same products, but I say that local objects suit local conditions best, and that faceless uniformity worldwide is an unwelcome and dreary prospect.",8.5,8.5,8,8.5
94,Topic," Museums are unique places where you get to experience the history from past to the latest technology. However admission is required when entering.  Museums are popular places to go to on a weekends with family or friends. Admissions are one of the funds which keeps the museum running and also to maintain its exhibits. Without admission museums would be dirty, poorly maintained, and likely impossible to operate, unless funded from government or charity.  However admissions are one thing which may keep the customer from entering. Usually we have to pay around $30 for admissions. Children or family which doesn’t earn much simply can not afford such amount. They will go to museum which is free or even not go and experience the greatness of the museum, which I think is horrible because it should be open for everyone.  I think having an admission is a disadvantage since museums should be open for everyone, but admissions are essential for running the museums. So I think it is very important to come up with a plan so that museums could be operated but also be admission free, such as goverment funding or doing a charity. Auckland Museum is one great example. It is one of the biggest museums in New Zealand but it is also free of admission since it’s goverment funded.",5.5,5.5,5.5,5.5
95,Topic," Many may say, and i agree, that today's society has almost erased all its boarders and soon will become limitless in what concerns travelling for both work and pleasure. Therefore, if this is to happen,then learning a new language is necessary.  Nowadays, learning a new language for the purpose of working in other countries seems to become more and more popular.Adults in need of money or, why not, recognision are trying to pursue their happiness far away from home. Also, the heydays of employers looking only for capable people have gone. It seems that today's employers are looking for not only for multi-skilled employees, but they also want people who know more than their mother tongue. Sooner or later, those who omitted more are prone to become jobless.  However, to my mind, a new phrase should not be learned just for travelling or working in a foreign country. A foreign idioms should help the learner broaden his mind. By this I mean that the new word should and will allow us to understand more about the world itself, and maybe our ancestors' ways of thinking and acting. Needless to say, knowing another speech will help us when it comes to understanding the human race, because lingo is the first poem of a country.

97,What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?," Studying at university is certainly fraught with problems that students have to deal with. Starting university is like starting a new life. There are various challenges that every student inevitably struggles with during university life, which most students are not prepared for and end up being overwhelmed. In my opinion, among all these problems, difficulty in social communicating and time management are common to all students. The inability to communicate socially in a larger and newer environment than school can be the first problem which some students, especially freshmen and shy ones, face. Inability to find friends and communicate with classmates can lead to problems such as depression. For this reason, if a student takes the first step well, he/she can deal with some of the other problems more easily. Inability to manage time and use it properly is the second problem that university students often face. For many, college courses require much more effort; from trying to study to living alone and doing the required chores, most of the students are not able to manage and think about their time and do not have enough concentration due to lack of sleep because they do not have enough time to do their activities. Proper planning is the most important action that a student can take to reduce irregularities. Naturally, every student faces difficulties in university life which he/she has to deal with in order to get through his/her studies well. If the student is sufficiently prepared and strong to face problems, he will not suffer from problems.

98,It is not worth going to university anymore. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," Choosing whether or not to go to university is a massive decision. It can have a huge impact on a person’s life, because one has to live with the consequences of this important decision for the rest of his/her life. Nowadays, many people accept university education, because they believe that it is an important part of becoming wealthy and successful. There are so many potential benefits that come with a college education. I, personally, believe that the most important benefits of going to university are job prospects as well as an effective development of social relations. Having a higher education degree provides people more job prospects. Those, who have the degree, are more likely to find the job they are looking for and thus grow their economy and earn money. Employers may assume a person is better qualified for higher-paying jobs if he/she has a degree even if the degree is not related to what he/she has be doing on the job. On average, people with college degrees make more than people without college degrees. University is not all about the job prospects, it is also a golden opportunity to meet new people. Being on campus, exposes people to different perspectives and ideas, and meeting people with different backgrounds and perspectives results in greater open-mindedness and a more worldview. What is special about a college environment is that you’re living with hundreds or even thousands of people who are around your age, probably for the first and only time in your life. Overall, there are so many potential benefits that come with a university education. University can be very essential towards life, because it can provide job security, better career opportunities and a stable future. It also gives people the opportunity to develop their personal and professional interests. Many students head off to school with no idea what they want to do with their lives; University gives them a chance to try out different fields. Some people even believe that it can provide the life that many people wish and dream of achieving.",8,8,8,8

," Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however, argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishments","Everyday, we hear about one crime or the other and we also hear about punishments being handed out to criminals. Some people believe that there should be the same punishment for a given type of crime while others believe that punishment should be give out based on the circumstances of the crime and the motivations of the perpetrator. This essay will discuss both sides of the coin and put forward the argument that each crime must be analysed separately.  Some people say that a crime is a crime and hence deserves the same kind of punishment. In their eyes, if someone robes a bank off a million dollars or if a beggar  steals a packet of cookies from a grocery store, both these crimes are of the same nature and hence both criminals deserve the same treatment. If a person with  a past criminal record commits murder, or if a person kills someone in self defense, they both should be equally guilty in eyes of the law. While this line of  thinking seems absurd, it does offer one advantage, that of fast tracking the legal procedure. Legal cases are notorious for running for decades and by  standardizing the punishments, victims and their families might get closure quickly.  However, there is another side to the story. Most crimes are not black and white and there are shades of grey which must be considered before announcing judgements.  Consider two scenarios: firstly, a woman who kills her attacker in self preservation and secondly, a man kills and robs another person. Can you  imagine both the woman and the man being sentenced to 10 years in prison? Wouldn't that be incredulous! The former is not even a criminal, instead, she is a  victim of a crime.  To conclude, the merits of assessing each crime on a case to case basis outweigh the merits of treating crimes in a homogeneous manner. Each situation presents a unique set of circumstances and these must be taken into consideration before announcing punishments. ",5.5,5.5,5.5,5.5

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","It is common opinion that for a certain illegal act should always correspond the same punishment. Others believe that law should keep into consideration the person reasons and the actual situation when establishing the punishment. In this essay I will analyse both sides and express my view about this matter.  Nowadays many argue that one commits a crime, a correspondent fixed punishment should be always applied without considering the specific circumstances. In fact, some people think that it would not be fair to change the level of punishment based on a specific situation. For example, in the case of two people committing the same illegal action, if the type of punishment would depend on the personal reasons of a criminal, one person could end up in prison, while for the second one it could mean no jail time, only because the individual circumstances were different. Many could argue that this would not be fair and that the law should ensure that anyone doing the same illegal act receives also the same penalty.  On the other hand, others believe that it is necessary to consider the specific circumstances that lead someone to commit a criminal act. Based on gravity and on the motivations of a certain illegal action, the punishment should be therefore attenuated or aggravated. For instance, if two people would steal money, but one of them is a parent and he did it because he had lost his job and needed to feed his children, his circumstances could diminish his prison time.  In conclusion, I believe that the law should keep into consideration the personal motivations that lead a person to act illegally because there are several reasons that may push an individual into doing a crime. Therefore, I think that the juridical system should keep this always into account and I hope that it will be possible to apply more severe or lighter penalties based on the single case. ",6,6,6,6

In this essay, I  am going to examine this question from both points of view and then give my own opinion on the  matter.  On one side of the argument there are people who argue that the benefits of standardised  punishments considerably outweigh its disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is that it is  more efficient and cheaper to manage. One good illustration of this is parking tickets. If every one of  these had to go to court and be ruled upon by a judge and jury this would be very expensive and  waste a lot of people's time. It is also possible to say that this system is fairer because every person is
treated the same regardless of race or gender.  On the other hand, it is also possible to make the opposing case. It is often argued that in fact it is  better to consider the situation and reason of a crime. People often have this opinion because  sometimes people are forced to commit a crime such as murder due to reasons like self-defence.  Clearly, this should be considered in sentencing for the crime. A second point is that the reason for a  crime should be taken into account. A particularly good example here is that someone who steals  food to feed their family shouldn't be punished as someone who steals a watch because they want to  look wealthy.  In my opinion, both arguments have their merits. On balance, however, I tend to believe that it is  better to decide the penalty on a case-by-case basis, as getting the right decision is more important  than the justice system saving money.

Give reason from your own experience and examples where relevant ","Animals, undoubtedly, are an imperative part of the ecosystem. However, it has become a controversial issue that whether animals should be prevented from involving in experimentation and killed or not. As far as I am concerned, I deem that animals must be preserved, which I will explicate in the upcoming paragraphs.  On the one hand, all living beings have an equal right to live and animals also include in this class. Therefore, if any person eats the herbivores or carnivores, it is against the elementary right of living. Additionally, technology, nowadays, has emerged as a power which may have distinctive alternatives to do experiments instead on animals, which can be beneficial to stabilize the number of these creatures. Besides, the religious belief is associated with the view to not eat the animals. To elaborate it, some people who are related to some specific religion deny to feed on animals as it is against their religion. For an instance, Hindu masses refrain from eating cow since it is considered as a god among them. Consequently, research on animals is argued.  On the flip side, some individuals assert that animals are a good source of protein and vitamins. Therefore, these are eaten by human beings which is helpful to remain healthy. For example, chicken is prescribed by many doctors to the patients who have fracture as it is fruitful to get strong bones. Along with this, animals have some characteristics identical to humans, which cannot be found in any other living beings. Thus, they are the one on whom the research can be done easily to prepare any medicine. These are the factors why animal experimentation and feeding is supported.  In compendium, although it is advocated that there is nothing wrong in doing research work in addition to eating the animals, I am in favour of protecting the animals from experiments and becoming the food of the masses.

Many arguments have been made for and against this issue. In this essay, I will discuss both views and state my own position.  Opponents of animal abuse - sometimes called ""animal right activists"" - claim that animal in both food production and research activities have to suffer severe pain or even be killed since these activities require a wide range of chemical substances used for these animals. Moreover, a majority of livestock is beaten during food production activities, which is against moral values. For example, cows raised on farm have to endure terrifying, painful, and cruel procedure to make dairy products. Furthermore, these kinds of food are not essential as there are more alternatives which supplies more nutrients than animal meat; for example nuts, mushrooms, and beans.  Meanwhile, those who support the expansion of animal exploitation claim that animals used for research activities may be greatly beneficial for human beings. To be more specific, scientists could find new vaccines and drugs preventing terrible diseases by doing research on animals. This means that doctor have more chance to cure more patients who are severely ill, which could improve public health. In fact, scientists in the USA have explored a new vaccine for cancer treatment after testing on rabbits. Animal exploitation proponents also claim that the improvement of public health means that there is less burden to society.  In conclusion, while there are convincing arguments on both sides of the debate, I would argue that human uses of animal are necessary. It is not realistic for people to find alternatives for these activities. ",6,6,6,6

If ensuring the survival of human race means experimenting on as more animals as possible, then this should be done. Example of such opinion can be seen in various research laboratories all over the world where drug testing is initially done on animals before human trials are carried out. Should these animals not respond positively to these experimental trials, they are not carried out on human beings. This example clearly shows that human beings are more superior than animals and thus subject to exploitation.  On the other hand, those who think animals have equal right as humans opine that most of the reasons for predating on these animals are unnecessary. They argue, for instance, that most of the essential food nutrients needed by humans can be derived from fruits and vegetables which have even been scientifically proven to be more beneficial than animal products. To illustrate, in 2010, the Guardian newspaper, which is a reputable news magazine in Nigeria, published a study, carried out by the Nigerian Medical Association, to access the risk of cardiovascular disease among vegans and non-vegans. The study showed that there was double risk of developing cardiovascular disease among non-vegans when compared to their vegan counterparts who consumed more of plant product. Hence, it is clear that human beings do not compulsorily have to feed on animals.  To conclude, although some people argue that using animals for food and research can be considered ethical. I am of the opinion that both animals and humans can have an enduring symbiotic relationship which will ultimately benefit both ends. It is thus hoped that steps will be taken to improve the rights of animals to ensure continuity of this race. ",6,6,6,6

This trait has been observed in animal documentaries shown on major television channels such as Nat Geo Wild that these animals express signs of pain when they are hurt either by humans or fellow animals. They are even sometimes seen to mourn their loved ones who have passed on when such happen. These reactions are similar to what obtains in the human race when such occurrences happen to them. It is thus clear why it is thought that animals should have similar rights as humans.  To conclude, although some people argue that using animals for food and research can be considered ethical.

","A large portion of demographic believe that animals should not be used for our livelihood because they are also living creatures have a right to live, whilst there is in abundance who have a strong urge of utilizing animals for their fundamental necessity. In my opinion, morally it is not right to kill animals, but dependent up to a certain extent is natural.  Every living creature has their birth rights to live. And that makes a vast number of humans to be sympathetic towards them as animals cannot express their agony. For instance a lactating cow is not allowed to feed her calf at content, as the milk is supposed to make a good dairy business for a man and perhaps it is immoral eventually No human would do that to their infants.  On the counter side when it comes to survival it becomes natural tendency to depend on any life supporting agent. Extreme climates makes hard to grow vegetation and people tend to rely on animals for food, skin etc. for example, people living in deserts cannot grow vegetation apparently makes them use meat as a prime source of food and camels as transportation.  Summing up as we see some facts which purely served a business purpose for mankind in turn makes me support the animal's right, it is not true to every extent, as people will need animals and their products at many aspects of life. So I end up suggesting the use of animals up to considerably limit and not exploit them. ",6,6,6,6
,"A growing number of people feel that animals should not be exploited by people and that they should have the same rights as humans, while others argue that humans must employ animals to satisfy their various needs, including uses for food and research. 0","There have been lots of debates about animal rights in different societies over last decade and sometimes we watch or hear from media that a group of people are protesting in each corner of the world to protect animal rights. However, this group believes that animals should not be endangered by humans, while some others point that human needs are more important and people should be allowed to use animals for their different purposes. Therefore, this essay has tried to cover both of mentioned views and would suggest a good way to solve the issue.  According to most of the history documents, the human has employed animals to have a better life from the time that civilisation has come to existence. In fact, the skin of animals has been considered as the first material for clothing industry and human has used the meat of them as a delicious food. These days, people spend money for these purposes and in addition scientists conduct most of their biology experiments on animals to find cures for illnesses.  Some people worry about the mentioned trend as many animals' species have been extinct because of exploiting them by the human. Actually, they believe that the God has created animals to live and human shouldn't kill them or destroys their life places for his needs. So, if no step is taken for this situation, our planet has no place for animals and we just can see animals in zoos which will be another way of employing animals by the human.  By contrast, some other argues that the God has created animals for human better life and it is inevitable that people use animals for their targets. In other words, it is such a life law that always the stronger kill the weaker for continuing the life and in the forest, wild animals kill other for food as human do it for his purposes. Therefore, human should exploit animals for food, clothes and to develop the science and no other way can be taken.  I think, therefore, this occasion is such a sophisticated issue and both of views are concerning one aspect of human and animal rights. But perhaps, the realistic solution is balancing human behaviour about animals. Put another way, human should try to replace other ways instead of exploiting animals, however; it is not possible to eliminate the role of employing animals in human life. ",6,6,6,6
,"A growing number of people feel that animals should not be exploited by people and that they should have the same rights as humans, while others argue that humans must employ animals to satisfy their various needs, including uses for food and research. 1","The animal is one of the living things, like the human. Some people believe that animals should be kept and treated well because they have the same rights as the human. Other people think that animal should be used for food, clothes, education, and research purposes. From my point of view, animals bring many advantages to the human life. But it does not mean human can treat them badly and even do exploitation.  As God creature, animals live and they have the same feelings like humans do, like pain, suffering, frustration, happiness, etc. People who advocate animal rights think that animals are equal as the human, so they deserve the same treatment.  People must not use animals for their necessity. For instance, using animals for experiments, using them for the entertainment business, killing them for foods or making clothes and many others is inhuman. These activities not only hurt the animals but also may destroy the balance of nature. In this case, people with this point of view believe that exploitation and violence in animals are cruel behaviour.  In contrast, some people argue that animals are created to fulfil human needs. They have a lot of benefits for human life. Firstly, animals can be used for education. Many scientists utilise animals for their research, like biology or medical study. It can really help people to enrich their knowledge about the earth phenomena and also to find new medications for helping the humans. Secondly, animals are really important as food sources. They can provide human nutrition. For example, fishes, crabs, lobsters, and meats are containing protein which is needed for human health.  In conclusion, I believe that animals give many benefits for humans. They can help improving human life, especially provide food. However, people should treat them in good ways. I agree that animals deserve to be treated well but it does not mean that they must be treated as equal as humans. ",6,6,6,6
,"A growing number of people feel that animals should not be exploited by people and that they should have the same rights as humans, while others argue that humans must employ animals to satisfy their various needs, including uses for food and research. 2","Since prehistoric era, animals have been widely used by humans and in different ways to fulfil several needs. They have provided main sources of food, clothes, transportation and other tools largely used for the well-being of humankind. Yet in the modern world, animals still offer an efficient and indispensable mean for scientists to develop killing edge vaccinations. Whether to ban the exploitation of animals in general or to continue profiting from them for the betterment of people's lives still a matter of dispute. I personally believe that animals' use in our lives should be strictly controlled.  In favour of securing the same rights as humans, some claim that animals should be treated in a moral and ethical way. They consequently require to stop slaughtering sheep and cows, for instance, simply to provision eatable meat. They additionally argue that though animals are driven by instinct rather by brain like humans, they still are living creatures and should enjoy their lives in peace.  On the other side, supporters of exploiting animals for the good of mankind evaluate their use in our lives as essential in different aspects. Firstly it is suspicious that humans may survive by merely rely on vegetable sources of food even though this is not impossible.  Secondly, it would be quite impossible to keep the pace of development in medicine, especially to counter epidemic diseases, if we restrain the scientists from experiencing on animals. However, testing each and every new drug on humans is unethical and inhuman.  To conclude, despite the unstoppable voices against the exploitation of animals, in general, it would not be easy for humans to evolve without utilising animals, however, humans should control this utilisation and regulate it firmly. Miss using animals like in circuses, zoos or illegal competitions should be completely prohibited since those activities are solely aiming fun and mere financial benefits and disregarding animals' suffering.

,"A growing number of people feel that animals should not be exploited by people and that they should have the same rights as humans, while others argue that humans must employ animals to satisfy their various needs, including uses for food and research. 8","The animal right has been a controversial issue ever since the dawn of industrialisation. Some argue that animals deserve to be treated the same way as humans, while others contend that humans must employ animals to fulfil their numerous needs. Both points of views will be analysed in this essay before a reasoned conclusion is drawn.  On the one hand, fair treatment of animals appears to be the moral thing to do. For example, animal rights activists groups have repeatedly performed studies that demonstrate that animals, when subjected to macabre conditions of slaughterhouses and laboratories, feel the pain in the same manner as human beings. Since most humans would never support the idea of inflicting such pain on their fellow human beings, it is only fair that animals should also be spared from this torment. When looking at this side of the argument, it is obvious why some support this stance.  On the other hand, many people opine that animals should be exploited in order to fulfil a number of human needs including food and research activities. Take pharmaceutical industry, for example, if humans stop testing drugs on animals to ensure their safety for subsequent human use, fatal damage could be caused to human beings as a result of using unsafe medicines. As without such medicines, the life expectancy of humans can fall dramatically, it is understandable why this point of view has garnered support.  Although both sides of this argument have indisputable virtues, it is felt that animal exploitation should only be upheld for medical research purposes. It is hoped, that animal sufferings in the laboratories will be minimised in the future. ",6,6,6,6
,"A growing number of people feel that animals should not be exploited by people and that they should have the same rights as humans, while others argue that humans must employ animals to satisfy their various needs, including uses for food and research. 9","It has become a debatable topic about the exploitation of animals by mankind. Some people believed that animals should not be exploited and should be treated fairly by human beings. In contrast, others think animals should be utilised to assist humans in various kinds of ways, such as the source of food or for medical testing. The following essay will discuss both views in details, but in my opinion, I believe that animals can be used as the source of food or to assist human beings in the proportionate way and human should treat them properly.  On the one hand, a group of people believe that mankind does not have the rights to exploit animals, as they are also living creatures. It is true that animals live by following their instinct, but they have the same feeling as human beings, therefore it would not be fair for mankind to exploit them. In several cases, it has been reported that some of the cows had cried before they were slaughtered in the slaughterhouse, which means that they also had the same feeling as human beings. In another reported cases, some of the animals was treated poorly by their masters, though they had been exploited heavily and made them sick or injured.  On the other hand, it is undeniable that mankind needs the assistant of animals in various kinds of ways. Firstly, some animals are needed by humans to assist them in producing and providing foods. In many countries, cows, buffalos or horses are used by farmers to cultivate their farming areas, and some dairy farms animals such as chicken and sheep are slaughtered for their meats. Without the existence of these animals, there would be a humanity issue about the lack of food supplies and starvation for mankind. Secondly, some animals are used in certain scientific experiments or medical testing for the sake of humanity. Several new drugs are being tested in some mice or monkeys before they are being tested on human beings. Although it might seem as an inhuman act, but these experiments have saved thousands of human lives.  In conclusion, people have different opinions about the exploitation of animals. Some people agree with the statement but others disagree with it. In my opinion, I think the employment or the usage of animals to help human beings is not a problem, as long as we exploit them in a proportionate way. For example, as many farmers use dogs as their assistant in their field and the dogs should be treated and fed properly. ",5.5,5.5,5.5,5.5

On the other hand, the rest of the people argue that animals should be used to satisfy various human needs, like food and research.  Both the sentences are correct on their part, but with slight differences. Firstly, this essay is going to explain the reason why animals should not be exploited by us.  One of the major concerns as it has always been is animal exploitation. Most people argue that animals should have equal rights as humans. Exploiting animals is a major concern because of the extinction of many different species in the world. The government should make sure that such species are not being manipulated by any entity. Let's take the example of tigers,  In the past few years the tiger population of the world was highly diminishing and it led them on the verge of becoming extinct. A large proportion of people in the late 90's were poaching tigers and this created a lot of worries among people in Asia. With a lot of protests and conservation groups on the run the government decided to take strict measures to save the tiger population from going extinct. They took actions like banning all kinds of trade related to them, for example, selling tigers in circuses and poaching. Today, the tiger population has risen to almost 60%. Thanks to this act of conservation by the people. In my opinion, it is very essential for us to not let people exploit any animal, because it is the duty of people to protect them and yes they should also have their rights so that people do not misuse certain animals.  While there are many people who want to save the animals by putting a ban on their exploitation, there are others who argue that they must use them to satisfy their needs such as food and research. As it is true that animals are required for our basic needs, but they should also be protected, because of the growing concern regarding global warming, we should minimise the consumption of meat in order to sustain our planet. As far as research is concerned, the associations should put a regulation on what can be used for research and how much of it can be used for the same. A recent study shows that by the 2050 most of our resources will diminish and sea levels will be at its highest. In order to avoid using animals as a food source scientists have now started growing meat in labs. By taking out one cell of a single animal, they have successfully grown meat in a laboratory. It is extremely necessary to take measures and avoid using animals as food source.  In conclusion, this essay suggests that animals shouldn't be exploited for human purposes and that using them for food source and research work should be very limited and should be under the observation of the righteous authorities. Conservation of animals is important for a better and sustainable world. ",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

Discuss both views and give your opinion. ","Although it is sometimes thought that animals ought to stay unexploited by humans, others believe that they should be used for numerous human purposes. In my opinion, I consider that animals' safety is important and that is why people should not exploit them.  On the one hand, some people think that well-being of a human is paramount, thus life and needs of a mankind should be prioritized over the animals' rights. In other words, humanity tend to use animals in various ways to satisfy basic needs which, consequently, may lead to extinction of animals. To illustrate, some people serve them as food to overcome hunger, some corporations even use them as testing samples to observe reaction which some component may occur. Furthermore, being driven to exploit animals may be vital in order to survive in cold climatic zones where temperature degrees go as low as -50 Celsius. People are not able to exist in such temperatures without help of an animal, they frequently use animals' fur and fat to get warmer.  On the other hand, some people think that rights of animals should be taken into account, because otherwise number of endangered species will rise dramatically and I agree. The planet Earth is settled by billions of species such as humans, animals and plants. In that matter, moderate functioning is possible only when each of them is in balance. By that I emphasize importance, which animals bring into our life. For example, if snakes had not existed, other species would have not destroyed, as a result flora and fauna will be in danger. In addition, more and more people prefer to keep an animal such as cat or dog for living a versatile life full of adventures.  In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinions, I think that animals' rights and safety should be saved because their contribution for a well-being of a person is difficult to overestimate.

Both views will be critiqued further with relevant examples.  To initiate with examining the former opinion, animals are have been ratify very helpful to fulfil various human requirements so, it is totally unjustified that we put animals' lives in a dangerous. There are immense alternatives are available to accomplish our necessities. Furthermore, by exploitation of animals we indirectly affected adversely. To elaborate, found are significant for the ecosystem, it they escape continuously then a whole cycle is imbalanced and more negative outcomes, which affects on humans' lives.  On the contrary, some people in a favour of using animals because, according to the paramedical field, before administration of drugs on humans, it is necessary to frost test on animals. This, in turn, by analysing reactions on an animal, they can make changes in composition of drugs. Moreover, there are few specific vitamins and nutritions, which are only getting from animals rather than from fruits and vegetables. Hence, in order to acquire particular benefits, non-vegetarians are ready to kill and digest creatures.  To infer and give my opinion, I would say that, with fast-paced of technology in every realm, we can find other ways to test medicines and have specific vitamins from other sources instead of falling innocent animals, which are the predominant part of the nature.

Some individuals think that these living creatures need to be made use of, for the gain of mankind, while others believe that these animals have the exact equal rights to live on the planet, just like any other homo sapiens. In this essay, I will discuss the merits and de-merits of both these arguments and discuss why it is important to not harm or utilise the animals for our own good.  Even though, it is unethical to utilise animals for fulfilling the needs of mankind, there are a few advantages to it. Firstly, animals are considered a good source of energy that can be tapped to provide with sufficient labour. For example, it is widely known that animals are majorly employed in farming and other laborious works in many developing countries like India. Secondly, animals can act as a source of food for the society by providing their meat, which in turn can help reduce the dependence of the society on the cultivated crops. Finally, in recent times, animals with the same genetic system as human beings are being increasingly used in laboratories for testing. To exemplify, it is an accepted fact that lab rats were used to discover the drug for Corona virus strand in 2020.  However, there are a lot more de-merits of it. Not only does exploitation, harm the natural ecosystem of the environment, but also can result in the extinction or endangering of a few species. For instance, with exploitation of the farm animals and other domestic animals, it would directly result in the dwindling of their population and consequently harm the ecosystem. Likewise, hunting of wild animals would end up with the same consequence. Additionally, all animal beings are living creatures, who have the right to live just like every human being. Therefore, we cannot exploit them for our own good.  To conclude, exploiting the animals for our benefits have a lot of negatives and hence needs to be stopped altogether. The current trend of breeding animals, out of our selfishness further needs to be outlawed permanently. ",9,9,9,9

Firstly, humans kill animals for imperative purposes, for instance animal's body parts are being used by Doctors to evolve new medicines and to cure some dangerous diseases which are essential for the survival of humans. If animals will not be killed, then there population will get abundant which will be dangerous for both human and nature.  In addition, Scientists and doctors use to do their research and tests on the animals, so they can find the flaws before applying that on humans. If they directly apply that on humans, then it will lead to be a serious issue for the society. Eventually, these all are for the welfare of humans.  On the contrary, Due to after killing of animals, some species of animals are on endangered state and some of them have already been extinct, which includes some beautiful species like stingray, so Humans are destroying the nature. We cannot ignore the fact that animals have feelings too, and they are also a creation of god, so it is cruel to kill animals.  So it can be concluded, Despite the fact that animals have feelings, humans need to kill them for their own welfare and it is necessary for the survival of humans, but they must avoid excess killing of animals and killing of rare or endangered species to retain the beauty of our nature.

On the one hand, some people think that governments need to support the artists because they cannot raise enough funds to run the industry. In other words, artists require help because the revenue generated cannot be sufficient to effectively provide the services required of them. Furthermore, in order to prevent high entrance fee to places on interest like the art galleries, museums it is essential that the state continually supprts the artists. For example, there was a low turnout at the opening of the National museum in Lagos as a result of the high entrance fee. The management complained that lack of support from the governing bodies resulted in the high gate fee  In other words, the government can provide various machinery and other high end equipments, consequently, this will help the doctors and nurses carry out their job effortlessly and provide outstanding results. For example, since the government imcreased the Nigerian budget increased the budget of the health industry and dropped that of the art industryy, there has been a remarkable reduction in the mortality rate recorded. This emphasizes the need of government increased and continual support the  In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinions, I believe that it is highly essential that the government focuses more on improving the health of the public by providing high end equipments to ease the jobs of the health practitioners.

It is clear that the humans need for animals for a living. We can benefit from the animals the most importantly as food, researches, even if customs.

Discuss both views and give your opinion. Give reasons from your own experience and examples where relevant. 3","Many people claim that, animals should be treated in the way of humans, whereas others believe that, we should use animals for food, and scientific research. Let us examine both views before reaching a concrete decision.  It is true that, humans have no moral right to do experiments on animals, and they have a similar right to live. However, researchers may find alternative methods of research, which could help to reduce killing and suffering them. Consequently, it will affect wildlife habitats. For example, a recent study by Queen's University found that the extinction of different species animals due to animal testing and killing for different purposes. What is more, it has also been proven that humans can get all the nutrients, vitamin and protein from vegetables and fruits. Thus, killing animals for food would not be a strong reason.  On the other hand, animal testing helps to advance medical and scientific knowledge. Many important medical discoveries involved experimentations on animals. One clear example is finding the treatments of many diseases. If medical and scientific research has not been developed, humans suffering from illness could have not been cured. For this reason, medical tests and scientific studies are crucial on new drugs. In the USA, for instance, scientists found new elements of the cancer investigation, and they might have to do a test on animals. Furthermore, people think that everything on the earth must be done to ensure human survival, so if we use animals for food and other uses, then this morally acceptable.  To conclude, although, some people argue that killing animals for food and studies is ethical; I would say that it is completely natural for us to kill animals for food. But I would not support testing for the cosmetics and clothes industries. ",8,8,8,8

However, other people consider animals as a creature for humanity interests and human can exploit them for different demands such as food and research. Overall, both of views have some positive and negative aspects and they are controversial. However, I believe that people should choose alternative strategies in food sources and research fields.  There are two controversial views about animal rights. Some people feel that animals are created for humans and people can exploit them for satisfying human needs. Therefore, they believe that meat and poultry are rich in protein, vitamins and minerals which are vital as healthy food sources. On the other hand, humans cope with different disease and disorders and scientists have to use animals as a research model in medical fields. Therefore, this group of people believes that killing animals are morally acceptable and inevitable.  But most of the people believe that animals have a same right as humans. In fact, they feel that people can choose alternative strategies and we have not to use animals as food. It means green vegetation and food are high in protein, vitamins and minerals while in contrast to meat, they are low in animal fats. Also, technology development can scientist to use cells as a research model for investigation in medical fields. Hence, humans do not have to make various excuses for abusing animals.  In conclusion, animal rights are controversial viewpoints and there are different opinions about ethical issues in dealing with animals. In my view, animals have the same rights as humans and we must not exploit them for human interests. ",7.5,7.5,7.5,7.5

Many opine that animals possess equal rights as human race and should not be exploited by the mankind. However, others believe, animals must be used for different purposes, such as, for research or as a food resource. In my opinion, animals should be employed to fulfill various needs and to add comfort in human life.  Every creature has equal importance in this world. Animals add beauty in our life. As an illustration, statistics by the psychology department of Pakistan revealed, people who often visit serene places such as jungles or zoo suffer less from depression as compared to others. Thus animals play a vital role in our life and their uniqueness should be taken care off.  Humans are considered superior to other species in every aspect of life. Therefore, many believe that they can use other creatures for their own benefits. To illustrate, many drugs are tried on animals instead of humans due to their unpredictable outcomes. Hence, the mankind get advantage of animals by not only doing research, but by using them as a food source. People slaughter animals to obtain nutrition, as the meat from them is full of vitamins and minerals. Ultimately produce a positive impact on health.  To conclude, major proportion of people believes that animals should not be misused for human benefits as they are equally important. However, in my view, animals should be used for various purposes to ease the mankind. This trend will increase in foreseeable future. ",6,6,6,6

While there are some good arguments in favour of treating animals in the same way humans are, I believe that it is better use them as we desire for food and medical research.  There are certain people in society which claim that animals should be treated fairly by human beings. The reason is they are also living creatures, and they have the same feelings like humans, such as happiness, pain, and so on. Therefore, they deserve the treatment in the right way. Moreover, killing animals for human needs may destroy the balance of nature. Because, animals have their own ways of population control and harmful human activities are not morally acceptable.  On the other hand, some individuals argue that animals are created to fulfil human needs. Firstly, animals are important as food sources. They provide people nutrition, which is essential for living. For instance, sheep are consumed because of being high in protein Secondly, animal research brings in manifold benefits for human life, especially in education. Results from animal studies are crucial for closing knowledge gaps about health and disease in both humans and animals. Understanding cell and organ function help researchers design experiments to test new treatments in people. For example, several new drugs are being tested in some mice or monkeys before they are being tested on human beings.  In conclusion, there are convincing arguments both for and against treatment of animals. However, it seems to me that animals have the same rights as humans and deserve to be treated fairly.

Despite this, others say that animals are necessary to satisfy multiple demands in cooking and experimentation. In my view, society has no right to exploit a living creature against its will.  To begin with, An outstanding amount of people have animals as pets and treat them as family members on a daily basis. For instance, a canine needs to be fed, educated, and shown affection. If it is wounded, it needs to be taken to the vet. In other words, it is like a toddler. It is irrational to think about hurting a child or eating somebody else's son. Animals see, feel, and suffer like a person. Moreover, modern life offers multiple alternatives not to consume meat.  On the other hand, some people argue that animals are our property and that label encourages us to do with them whatever we please. Moreover, we use parts of their bodies in the things we use on a regular basis. To illustrate, the jelly beans are made with bones of cows, and most of the cookies in the market have animal grease. Besides, we use them for experimentation, as is the case with primates, mice, and whatever creature we think that can be detectable. The industry is annihilating animals, and we do nothing because our well-being could be threatened.  What is undoubtedly remarkable is that all animals are equals, and there is no difference between a pet and a cow, they feel and suffer in the same way. In my opinion, we should stop participating in the butchered industry and start to use other alternatives. It does not matter if our taste is changed. It is for the welfare of all species that we should preserve. ",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

Both the viewpoint will be discussed below.  One aspect implies on providing equal and free life for animals, similar to the one that humans are entitled to. In regard to the prospect, using animals for entertainment must be banned. Animals are used for various amusement purposes like hunting, in zoos and in circuses. Millions of animals are killed every year for meat, cloth or medicine, which in turn leads to selective breeding of animals for human needs. Advancement of science and technology in medical field employs animals as test subjects. Using animals for experimental purpose leads to a lifetime of torture and enslavement for the living being. Neglecting pets and abusing animals is a cruelty we see around us.  Since the dawn of development, humans have employed animals for hard labour. Carrying heavy loads, farming and transport are some areas where animals are still being taken advantage of. Animal labours are a necessity for human growth. Another major need for which animals are used is meat. It is a hard known fact that human survival does depend on animals. The nature has its own way to maintain balance through the food chain. All animals depend on one or the other life form to feed, it is a basic rule of nature. Some endangered species are kept in a safe environment by humans and we need to give more emphasis on protecting near extinct animals.  After discussing both points, it is concluded that humans may use animals based on necessity. Unwanted cruelty and exploitation should be avoided. We should be more considerate and kind towards animals, and have to teach these values to our children as well. It is best to leave an animal in their natural habitat rather than locking them up for our entertainment. Moderate killing of animals needs to be practiced, we need to learn to live on other sources and not always depend on animal source of nutrition. A selfless decision can flourish both human and animal life",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

Some people believe that animals should be kept and treated well because they have the same rights as the human. Other people think that animal should be used for food, clothes, education, and research purposes. From my point of view, animals bring many advantages to the human life. But it does not mean human can treat them badly and even do exploitation.  As God created, animals live and they have the same feelings like humans do, like pain, suffering, frustration, happiness, etc. People who advocate animal rights think that animals are equal as the human, so they deserve the same treatment. People must not use animals for their necessity. For instance, using animals for experiments, using them for the entertainment business, killing them for foods or making clothes and many others is inhuman. These activities not only hurt the animals, but also may destroy the balance of nature. In this case, people with this point of view believe that exploitation and violence in animals are cruel behaviour.  In contrast, some people argue that animals are created to fulfil human needs. They have a lot of benefits for human life. Firstly, animals can be used for education. Many scientists utilise animals for their research, like biology or medical study. It can really help people to enrich their knowledge about the earth phenomena and also to find new medications for helping the humans. Secondly, animals are really important as food sources. They can provide human nutrition. For example, fishes, crabs, lobsters, and meats contain protein which is needed for human health.  In conclusion, I believe that animals give many benefits for humans. They can help improving human life, especially provide food. However, people should treat them in good ways. I agree that animals deserve to be treated well, but it does not mean that they must be treated as equal as humans. ",8,8,8,8

A good strength of humans believes that animals should not be exploited and the other side suggests they are needed to satisfy various needs of humans. This essay will discuss both the sides of the argument and will put forward the evidence for exploiting the animals.  Some set of people argues that humans need support from animals for various reasons. It is believed that, human survival is the most important thing in this world. When compared with humans, animals are less painful. Although they add beauty to nation, but more than that, the survival of the human is essential. They provide good strength to the humans, thereby increasing their resistance towards diseases. New research, will lead to the invention of a new drug, which is most likely to be tested on the animal's body. Human life is more valuable when compared to animals, as even in the failure of those drugs it will affect anyone, expect diversity. As an illustration, in 2003, a new cancer drug was invented and they were injected into mouse, which was most probably to show positive results, and finally it landed on the other side. However, if this was injected in humans, then we would have seen a dramatic tragedy.  On the other hand, the majority of the population believes that, humans and animals must be treated with the same rights. Many protests against using animals for the benefits of humans. They argue that all the vitamins and minerals that are provided by animal species, are present in vegetables and fruits. The brain functions faster, if consumption of meat is reduced. By, declining the use of meat as a food will also make a person more intelligent. The rate of exploitation of animals, would come down if eatery purpose is reduced.  To conclude, although quite a lot of people argue for equal rights for both animals and humans, testing of research on animals has less effect when compared to humans. So, furthermore, animals should satisfy the needs of humans, as the existence of human in this world is considered to be the one with more priority. ",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

Discussion has centered whether animals ought not to suffer from the exploitation of human or humans have right to use animals in their needs including provision of food and research. Both two sides are discussed before I give my opinion.  On the other hand, animals play an important role in research because that can ensure the precise of products or study before publishing and discourage the least other sides. For example, in complex surgery, doctors or experts need to do experiments on animals in order to have some results or action and consider before taking action on human. Besides testing on human in cosmetics industry is banned so testing on animals is the best choice. Moreover, animals are main resource for food because they provide a certain source of nutrition and energy. Especially, in some areas such as the ethnic group, the locals having a low salary job must hunt animals so as to manage their life.  On the other hand, it is acceptable that animals who are born and exist have the same rights as human. They should not be behave badly and should live with humans to support each other. It is proved that when humans grow up a pet and live together, it helps people to reduce stress and the capicity of cancer. In the world, there are a lot of situation that doctors use animals treatment. When patients suffer from disorders or expression, unability, they live with a pet who enable them to have better life and become more optimistic. Besides, animals create the natural environments. If human continue hunting animals such as wild animals and destroy forests, the nature and the fresh air will disappear, leading to lose the nature and the pollution. As a result, misusing animals not only lose the nature but also make people behave unnormally.

Conversely, some people claim that humans need to use animals either for eating or for scientific experiments. This essay is going to explain these two points of view and then give my opinion.  On the one hand, animals should have the same rights than humans since they are equally important for our planet. For example, we would not survive if all the bees, tiny insects, were extinct. Hence, we should respect and love all forms of life in our universe because we depend on them. Killing an animal should be the same than killing a human being.  On the other hand, humans need to eat certain substances to survive, such as protein, which is easier to obtain in large quantities by eating the meat of animals such as cows and pigs. Not mention the chemical tests that the pharmaceutical industry needs to apply on animals, for instance. Since, testing these substances in humans is illegal. For these reasons, animals are needed, otherwise our specie would be endangered.  To conclude, I totally agree that animals should be employed to serve human needs as they are an asset to our lives.

This essay will discuss both points of view.  With regard to the exploitation of animals, people believe it is acceptable for several reasons. Firstly, they think that humans are the most important beings on the planet, and everything must be done to ensure human survival. If this means experimenting on animals so that we can fight and find cures for diseases, then this takes priority over animal suffering. Furthermore, it is believed by some animals that do not feel pain or loss as humans do, so if we have to kill animals for foodstuff or other uses, then this is morally acceptable.  However, I do not believe these arguments stand up to scrutiny. Initially, it has been shown on numerous occasions by secret filming in laboratories via animal rights groups that animals feel as much pain as humans do, and they suffer when they are kept in cages for long periods. In addition, a substantial amount of animal research is done for cosmetics, not to find cures for diseases, so this is unnecessary. Finally, it has been proven that humans can get all the nutrients and vitamins that they need from green vegetables and fruit. Therefore, again, having to kill animals for cooking is not an adequate argument.  To sum up, although some people argue killing animals for research and cuisine is ethical, I would argue there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that is not the case, and, therefore, steps must be taken to improve the rights of animals.

On the one hand people say that have the same right as humans and should therefore be protected against the cruel treatment on behalf of humans. Moreover, all living things make up a balanced ecosystem and all things have rightful place and consideration. Animals are sentient being as well. Like humans, they have the ability to express emotions such as pain, fear, happiness, and despair. To prove this fact, there have been several experiments done on animals which clearly proves that they feel the same amount of suffering and loss as humans do.  On the other hand, some people think that animals provide various needs of people. Firstly, human population exploits a number of animals for food, including pig, cow and chicken poultry. They are being raised as a food and provide products that are important to everyday life. For example, is the pork, it is widely consumed meat in the world and people eat different products like bacon, sausage and pork chop. Secondly, animals attributed to many lifesaving cures and treatments. Animal testing aids researchers in finding drugs and treatments to improve health and medicine. Take for instance, dogs had their pancreas removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, which help to save critical cases of people with diabetics.

This essay outlines the differences between animals and humans and explains why there should be an equilibrium between the two.  On one hand, more and more people think that animals should not be exploited and that they should be treated as humans, having the same rights. Moreover, this implies that animals should have the right to own a property, vote, or even decide over their own choices in life. Nonetheless, I tend to disagree with this argument, because animals do not own a concience like ours, thereby they don't have the ability to think as a humans does, thus they can not choose who their lider should be or how many acres of land they might need.  On the other hand, others think that animals should be like slaves, and there should be no interdictions on what we can do with them in order to satisfy our needs. Furthermore, this means that we can use these other life forms just for our well being. For example, using them for their meat and other foods they can produce, research, like drug research, or just other scientific projects that use animals as test subjects. Me personally, I can not say that I entirely agree with this type of thinking, because it's not, in my opinion, the right way treat animals. We should, however, treat them like cohabitants of this earth we share and have a respectfull relationship, trying to live toghether in symbiosis with both parts benefiting upon each other.  In conclusion, some people say that animals are at our disposal while others say that this kind of thinking is wrong and we should give them the same rights as human have.

","Throughout history, people have had a conflicted relationship with animals, adoring them as pets and yet exploiting them for food, entertainment and as research subjects. While some feel that this abuse is justified, others are strongly opposed. In this essay, I will discuss these views and explain why I feel that we should reduce our reliance on animals.  Many people claim that animals exist solely for our use and therefore, have few, if any, rights. The food industry, for instance, relies on the mass production of animals, most of which are kept in cramped and sometimes appalling conditions, which sometimes amount to torture. Since these animals are destined for slaughter anyway, some argue that their quality of life is irrelevant. The medical, scientific and cosmetics industries also use animals as objects, conducting painful and often fatal experiments on them, with little regard for their rights. Many people feel that the results of such tests are crucial to humankind and thus justify this inhumane treatment.  Despite this, others, myself included, feel that this exploitation of animals ought to be reconsidered. As they are sentient beings, capable of feelings and relationships, they deserve more respect. To achieve this, although Veganism may not suit everyone, it is certainly possible for people to cut down on meat consumption or at least make more ethical choices. In medical research too, the aim should be to reduce animal use, refine techniques and to replace them with other means. Given the range of alternatives available, the treatment of animals can no longer be justified.  In conclusion, humans have built their lives on the backs of animals. While some feel comfortable continuing in this way, I believe we now have other options available that allow us to protect their rights and still maintain our quality of life. ",8.5,8.5,8.5,8.5

Describe the advantages and disadvantages of tourism in the modern world. ","It is undeniable true that tourists are the primary element of income for some places. However, mis-management leads to various issues such as degradation of environment and distortion of cultural heritage. This essay will discuss the merits and demerits of tourism in this modern era.  Tourism has numerous positives despite the downsides in this sector. Firstly, it promotes cultural exchange among people from different cultures thereby allowing them to meet and understand each other. Therefore, give them the opportunity to respect and foster the cultural diversity. Secondly, it helps in boosting the overall economic growth of the nation as tourists spend lavishly on their vacations thereby improves the GDP of country. Thirdly, service sector which is directly linked to tourism provides various job opportunities for young adults. For instance, a survey conducted in 2017 depicts that the number of jobs in the hilly areas of India rose to 20% because of visitors.  Nevertheless, there are many benefits of tourism but there are some disadvantages of the same. The major problem is that people tends to destroy the local architecture and natural habitat of the region by throwing waste products and scribbling over monuments. In addition to this, resorts owners cut down the trees for their profits and to attracts more tourists therefore, degrading the environment. Moreover, at some places tourists spreads illegal activities such as importation of drugs and weed which as a consequences, destroying the peace. To illustrate, the rise in crime at historic places has increased from 25% to 40% due to these practices.  In conclusion, tourism catalyses the growth of nation along with generation of employment yet it leads to destruction of natural habitat and heritage sites. ",6,6,6,6

This essay will discuss both merits and demerits of this trend, and I believe that tourism has more benefits outweigh the drawbacks.  A large number of benefits can be attributed to the development of the tourism industry. Firstly, the tourism industry contributes to the economy of the nation and also provide jobs for local people. In other words, not only tourists can spend money in various places such as hotels, transportation, food, and medical services but also the economy of the country is getting stronger. Secondly, the industry of tourism increases the employment for local people by bringing new jobs. For instance, if the number of tourists visiting the country means increasing the demand for hotel staff, restaurant workers, tour guides, and many more. As a result, business owners hire more people for these positions.  However, tourism also has some drawbacks affecting the environment and damaged popular tourist's places, like Historical building, Temple and Monuments. Furthermore, the vast number of visitor rush can destroy the places and also creates environmental problems. For example, when these places are overcrowded, natural resources and famous buildings often became overexploited. Needless to say, all these demerits have a far-reaching impact on the flora and fauna.  In conclusion, although tourism can have certain negative effects like the destruction of nature, however, it has also a positive impact on the economic growth of the country. ",6,6,6,6

Firstly, tourists spend money on a wide range of services, including hotels, amusements, transportation, food and medical services. This way, tourism yields an additional income, greatly supporting the country's economy. Secondly, tourism increases the level of employment by bringing new jobs. For instance, the influx of tourists results in a larger demand in restaurant workers, tour guides, hotel staff and employees of retail services, exhorting business owners to hire more people for these positions.

However, proper hospitality management and correct usage of tourism revenue by the local government can eliminate these disadvantages.  To conclude, although tourism can have certain negative effects like destructive impact and growth of crime rate, it has an extremely positive influence on the country's economy and provides a large number of new jobs for the local people. I believe that these benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks. ",6,6,6,6

Do you think that benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks?","Nowadays, tourism, as a resource of profit, have become very attractive. However, it is considered that tourism business can also lead different problems. The aim of this essay is to look at negatives and positives of leisure industry.  On the one hand, tourism plays a huge role in the development of country. In other words, it is a great industry that boosts the economy, contributes to the development of infrastructure and even though generally contributes to the prosperity of city and country. For example, this industry provides people with jobs, plays a tremendous role in local educational system. Above all it acts as a way of cultural exchange between foreigners and citizens. Consequently, tourism is a developer of country.  On the other hand, leisure industry causes irreparable damage to the environment. This means that tourism can cause the risks of erosion, pollution, forest fires, even if most of them behave responsibly. For example, thousands of people travel all over the world and visit the ancient buildings, mausoleums and this in turn increase the traffic, and nature suffers from this. Accordingly, tourism industry has global implications that may not be visible yet.  To sum up the industry of tourism has both advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion the benefits of industry exceeds drawbacks as it also can help to regenerate the environment, and can perform as international connection between people all over the world. ",5,5,5,5

Describe the advantages and disadvantages of tourism in the modern world. Do you think that benefits of tourism outweight its drawbacks? ","Over the last few years, the tourist industry has been growing enormously. While tourism generates a significant portion of income for many countries around the world, there are also drawbacks to consider. This essay will examine the advantages and disadvantages of tourism before arriving at a reasonable conclusion.  First and foremost, it is true that tourism contributes to the economy of a nation as well a large number of employment opportunities for local inhabitants. Tourists spend a lot money on various services such as hotels, transportation, food and medical, due to the fact that, more money is adding to the economy of a nation. In addition, tourism increases employment for local people by bringing new jobs. For example, the rush of tourists results into more demand of hotels, tourist guider and many more, this encourage local business to hire more people to fulfill the needs.  However, tourism also has some drawbacks affecting the environment and state of cleanliness of popular tourist places. For example, Bali, a destination which is located in the Southeast of Indonesia, has been getting hotter day by day, due to the increasing number of tourists. In the past few years, the average temperature got increased from 25 to 28 degree Celsius. Moreover, most of the places lack of cleanliness because of overcrowd in these places.  In conclusion, although tourism has some drawbacks such as environmental impact and cleanliness, however, it has a positive impact on the economy of the country and provide a large number of jobs. I believe that advantages totally outweigh the disadvantages. ",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

Describe the advantages and disadvantages of tourism in the modern world. Do you think that benefits of tourism outweight its drawbacks? ","Tourism is a major revenue-generating business in today's world as more and more individuals and families prefer to spend their holidays away from their busy urban life. Although there are certain disadvantages of tourism, its wonderful advantages such as local economic development, job creation and so on eclipse the problems caused by it.  Tourism comes with few specific disadvantages owing to the mix up of foreign cultures with local culture. Tourists often come with prohibited drugs and other intoxicating substances to either consume or even sell them at the places of attraction, which might create law and order problems and promote drug addiction among natives. Furthermore, foreign tourists being vulnerable, attract attention of local criminals. This tendency can lead to an increase in crime rate at popular tourist spots. The beautiful beaches of Digha, West Bengal, for instance are now having regular incidents of alcohol-abuse, murder and snatching which is tainting its reputation a lot.  Given that there are few demerits of tourism, it has so many significant benefits as well to the local community. Apart from generating a lot of revenue which helps the local government, it encourage the preservation of local culture as many tourists prefer to acquaint themselves of history, language and cuisine of the tourist place. This promotes the construction of museums, local musical bands and restaurants. Additionally, tourism creates the demand for certain jobs like interpreter guides and contributes towards the growth of local hotels and shops.  In the line of conclusion, tourism's advantages has a clear edge over the disadvantages. Therefore, I believe that every government should work towards development of tourism and provide adequate policing to keep the law and order issues at bay. ",6,6,6,6

Describe the advantages and disadvantages of tourism in the modern world. Do you think that benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks? 4","Tourism is deemed a prominent component contributing to not only private income, but also government's revenue in many countries in this era; however, this industry presents a large number of drawbacks when it is not managed properly. From my point of view, despite the downsides, advantages which tourism brings are more considerable.  On the one hand, touristry maintains two disadvantages in terms of preserving heritages along with protecting the local environment. With respect to preservation, there is likelihood that historic heritages are prone to damage when more tourists come to these destinations. This ruin might trace its roots from the poor sense of responsibility of visitors as well as the dearth of prevailing laws to protect these sites of governments. Besides, an increasing number of visitors spells a trouble that the environment in local places will be put under great pressure since these people could emit a great deal of gadget. Many fishes in NhaTrang, a prominent beach in Vietnam, for instance, died when they were caught in bottles of tourists in 2008.  On the other hand, I believe that such industry offers a variety of benefits which might outweigh the drawbacks mentioned. Firstly, travel could boost national economy sustainable because this activity does not require fossil fuel. This also means that the economy will be more stable as the authorities do not need to think of material supply. Moreover, this kind of industry offers local residents new jobs such as tour guides, hotels, restaurants, which are profitable. As a result, the income of these people will be improved and they have the opportunity to attain a higher living standard.  In conclusion, I suppose that tourism has its own pros and cons; however, the advantages brought are somewhat predominant over the disadvantages",7.5,7.5,7.5,7.5

Do you think that the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks? 5","It is true that many economies in the world these days depend heavily on revenue generated from tourism. While there are certain negative consequences of this development/phenomenon, I would argue that these are outweighed by the advantages.  On the one hand, heavy reliance on the tourism industry can cause some disturbing problems. The first downside is the likely destruction of popular destinations. In particular, ancient buildings, temples and monuments struggle to cope with a vast amount of visitors' traffic and get damaged. Also, the large number of tourists can cause environmental problems. For instance, when places of interest are overcrowded, natural resources often become overexploited. What's more, the fact that tourists usually bring a lot of cash and carry valuable items such as phones, cameras, expensive handbags increases the attraction for criminals and brings with it activities like robbery and drug dealing.  On the other hand, despite such issues, many benefits can be derived from the growing development of the tourism industry. Firstly, it is clear that the tourism industry can significantly boost a nation's economy in many aspects. This can be explained by tourists' spending on a wide range of services, including hotels, amusements, transportation, food, and medical services. Secondly, the growth of tourism also increases the level of employment by bringing new jobs. For instance, the influx of tourists results in large demand in restaurant workers, tour guides, hotel staff and employees of retail services, exhorting business owners to hire more people for these positions.  In conclusion, I believe that the advantages of tourism, especially in terms of increased GDP and employment rate, are greater than the drawbacks, namely destruction impact on many destinations and the environment as well as higher crime rate.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of tourism in the modern world? Do you think that the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks? ","Although holidaymakers contribute hugely to the economies of many popular destinations, the influx of tourists can also cause serious issues. This essay will demonstrate how tourism can transform the economy of poor areas, but will also show that this can lead to such problems as the displacement of local people. Whilst acknowledging that there are drawbacks, the essay will argue that the advantages of the tourist industry outweigh the disadvantages.  One country that has experienced a significant economic boost from tourism is Thailand. Over the past 50 years, many of its small fishing villages, where people often struggled to make a living, have been developed into thriving holiday destinations. With all the hotels, restaurants, shops and other tourist facilities that have been developed, there are now enough jobs for everyone and the general standard of living has greatly increased. Many local people have spotted new business opportunities and become entrepreneurs which has further diversified the economy.  In Venice, on the other hand, the huge popularity of the beautiful canals and stunning architecture with visitors from around the world has had a negative impact on local residents. The growing need for tourist accommodation, places to eat and shops have forced many people from their homes to make way for this new development. Not only have these people suffered by having to move away from their family and friends, but the situation has also resulted in a lost sense of community in the worst affected areas.  In conclusion, although mass tourism can sometimes result in local residents having to be relocated, it greatly improves the lives of most people as well as contributing significantly to the national economy. Hence, the positive effects of developing a tourist industry definitely outweigh the drawbacks. ",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

In my opinion, tourism has many benefits like economic development of the country compared to any disadvantages it might bring.  Despite the drawbacks mentioned below, tourism has many benefits like the economic development of a country. When the foreigners from several different countries visit a place, they bring revenue with them. It provides local people with a lot of job opportunities like the tour guides, hotel business flourishes with booking of extra number of rooms and the earning of restaurants quadruples as the tourists take an interest in local cuisines. In addition, it helps to spread the culture and traditions of a country internationally. This may help in a number of ways to improve the international image of a country. For example, ever since, Pakistan has opened its door for international tourism, image of the state has changed into peace loving and noble country. This is of crucial importance in the era when a fierce neighbour is trying to tarnish the image of our country in international politics, hence, tourism is the solutions to send a soft image to the world.  Admittedly, there are a few drawbacks of tourism related to the places which have a maximum influx of traveller during a particular season. For example, the northern areas of Pakistan receive maximum tourists in summer, in other seasons the areas become inaccessible. The local people may lose interest in agriculture and farming as it requires more energy compared to working as a tour guide so it may lead to decrease in crop production. Moreover, the towns and cities may become overcrowded with tourist, especially during vacations and may interfere with daily activities of local people.  In conclusion, the benefits of tourism far outweigh the few minor drawbacks which can easily be managed if government takes adequate measures. ",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

In the modern world, it is one of the most popular industries which in charge of large proportions of the economy. This essay will discuss these factors in detail.  Let us first understand the benefits. The places that are not well known, are able to become popular by promoting themselves. In addition, it helps to improve the country's economy by increasing foreign exchange, at the same time, it also assists in the development of infrastructure. When encouraging tourism, various cities give visitors opportunity to understand the lifestyle, which would attract investors, while benefitting local businesses. For instance, Dubai has tremendously developed over the last 40 years in the same way.  Nonetheless, there are drawbacks to the same. Many countries provide visas without enough scanning, to increase the number of visitors every year. Which would lead to a lot of illegal immigrants who come in search of jobs and do not return. The inability to control this situation, may often lead to an increase in crime. Perhaps, it is important that the right measures are taken to ensure safety of citizens. For example, some places provide on arrival for number of nationalities, with no checks on job position which could eventually worsen the economy.  To conclude, it is a good industry, however, it should be controlled and monitored properly by the government. Necessary measures should be taken, with appropriate laws to filter or control the type of immigrants. ",8,8,8,8

Regrettably, problems can arise from mismanaged tourism. Asides the fact that not all tourists are credible, some of them end up staying back and therefore, causing an increase in population. However, tourism enriches the nation by bringing development which attracts foreign investors.  Tourism can have a negative effect on a country, in the sense that some of the visitors might have criminal tendencies. For instance, some convicts may run away from their countries and disguise as tourists in another country. This will result to a high crime rate in the country.  Furthermore, some tourists do not leave at the stipulated time. With this increase in population comes overcrowding and poor standard of living. For instance, a recent survey in India revealed that 50% of the children in public schools belonged to parents who came in as tourists. So the citizens will be at the receiving end.  On the other hand, tourism has been a blessing to many nations. Besides the obvious fact that its a great revenue booster, it also brings about development and popularity of the country. Moreover, developed countries are known to attract investors. For instance, studies has shown that people put their money more in projects that they are certain will earn profit, that is, projects in developed countries. This will in turn enrich the nation greatly.  In conclusion, in as much as tourism may have brought increase in crimes and overcrowding, I believe it has done more good than harm. As it brings about the developed and popularity of a country. ",6,6,6,6
,A lot of social problems can be related to teenagers these days. Some feel that this is because parents are not able to spend enough time to take care of their teenage child. Do you agree or disagree? ,"At present time, teenagers are causing many social difficulties. Some think that it is happening due to spending few time of parents with their children and they are engage with their own job. I agree with this statement because the parents are busy with building own career and they are most likely to support their family financially.  Everyone wants to create his own background without depending anyone. The major means of creating base is earning money and today's generation is tend to do so. So, everybody want to study more and more so that they can figure out an easy way to find job for supporting themselves financially. Sometimes mothers do not leave their job after giving birth of a child. Thus, child do not get enough cear of its mother and grow up with loneliness. When this child become younger, he or she tend to do anything as they want, it might good or bad for society, and bad behaviour causes problem in society.  In other words, having job holder parents of a child get less guidance of parents, who work all day long in an institution, not get that much time to give their child. The parents sometimes ignore their child because of less time. For example, in my neighbourhood, some mothers and fathers both do job and stay minor proportion of their time in their home and with their children. Logically, their children get less guidance and get out from home to make noise and shouting in our roads which disturb the surrounding people. Some people also complained about this to those parents in spite of not getting any response. As a result of this, whole society is concerne about children and forcing them to leave the society.  In a nutshell, parents spending less time with children and more busy with their job are the main reasons of rising anti-social behaviour amongst children, because every parent busy to build their own background and give financial support to their family.

Do you agree or disagree? ,"In contemporary society, top priority has been given to youth as its importance in individual growth and social development. There is a controversial discussion among people that many social problems committed by teenagers are mostly blamed to parents' inadequant accompany. For my perspective, I strongly disagree with it, and I reckon social media and school have more essential impacts on this phenomenon.  To begin with, contents published on social media are not likely all optimistic for adolescents. It is commonly known that internet users have the right to speak free online to express their perosonal opinions. Since this case, questionable contents such as violence and pornography are easily imitated by teenagers due to immature value system. With that being said, parents are unlikely to prohibit teenagers' usage of social media in order to prevent imitation.  In addition, school plays an undeniable role in youths' social problems as most of them spend a large amount of time in school during week days. Without a doubt, teachers in school should not only impart textbook knowledge, but also teach correct behaviours. For example, young students have higher change to learn poor behaviours such as bully during school if teachers do not correct them immediately. Parents, in this case, are unaware of nothing if no one acknowledge them.  To sum up, I would certainly object the concept that parents are the main reason for teenagers' delinquency. As far as I am concerned, social media and schools should be more responsible for this phenomenon due to negative impacts from social media and late behaviour correction from schools. ",6,6,6,6
,A lot of social problems can be related to teenagers these days. Some feel that this is because parents are not able to spend enough time to take care of their teenage child. Do you agree or disagree? ,"Nowadays, there is an increasing number of negative social news related to teenagers, which makes many people attribute the problem to the parents' lack of concern for their children. From my perspective, while parents are indeed obliged to spend more time with their children, schools and the government also play important roles in dealing with the issue.  It is undeniable that a child's growing up is inseparable from the parents' care and cultivation. Scientific research has proved that the absence of motherly and fatherly love would subject a kid to a high risk of psychological trauma, thus obstructing him or her from growing to be a mentally healthy person that gets along well with others. Meanwhile, without the necessary supervision and guide from parents, young people would be easily attracted by the representations of violence and crimes on mass media. It follows that they may be motivated to practice violence in the real life and destabilize local community.  In spite of the significance of parenting and family education, one should not ignore the influence of schools, the government, and the entire society on children's personal development. It is in the school that teenagers spend most of their time and establish their knowledge system as well as values and morality. Thus, in addition to focusing on the students' academic performance, schools also need to pay more attention to their psychological wellbeing and guide them to think and behave properly. More importantly, the government should offer financial and institutional support to schools and families, such as increasing educational funding and releasing parents' pressure of raising children. Also, the government is expected to strengthen the censorship of films, TV shows, and the internet, thereby preventing children from exposure to explicitly violent contents.  In conclusion, teenagers' crimes and misconducts have a lot to do with the problems of their family and parents. Nonetheless, only through the efforts of schools, the government, and the whole society can those problems be effectively solved. ",6,6,6,6

Do you agree or disagree? ,"Youngsters in their teens today, are becoming a source for a lot of social issues. There is a great majority of people who have an opinion that this is because parents do not spend much time to look after their offsprings. This essay will discuss why I agree with the aforementioned.  In today's burgeoning competition, people thrive to be successful in their respective fields. For that, they work a lot harder and often miss out on spending a good amount of time with their children and family. To illustrate, with IT industry expanding with the current pace, an individual is willful to break the norms and work overtime to go hand in hand with other people in the same profession thus remaining aloof from the family time, particularly their young ones. These are some of the facts which explain the increasing differences between the parents and their adolescents.  In addition, modern day youngsters are also somewhat guilty of not devoting much time to their kin. They prefer giving most of their time to their pals thus leaving their parents longing for their love. To support this fact, in the USA, it has been found in a survey, that about 40% of the people in their teenage like spending much of their free time with their friends as they find a great sense of leeway there. It is for these reasons why today, parents and their children are not able to spend much of the time together.  To sum things up, teenagers today give rise to a lot of problems for the community. This essay discussed why I agree that parents should spend much more time with their family than what they are doing at present. ",6,6,6,6
,A lot of social problems can these days be related to teenagers. Some feel that this is because parents are not able to spend enough time and take care of their teenage child. Do you agree or disagree? ,"It is an inevitable fact that social problems related to teenagers are a popular, indisputable and debatable issue in this contemporary world. Who is responsible for these social problems? Is it the teenagers, parents or teachers? Well, I am inclined to agree with the statement that parents play a vital role in every individual's life. I would like to propound and expound on this topic to get to a concrete decision.  Firstly, many teenagers lack of social awareness does huge harm to environment by throwing the trash in nearby public areas, spitting and polluting the lanes with their 'No pollution control' vehicles. However, teachers and parents can educate them the effects of the environment. Furthermore, young adolescents talking some abusive and showing violent behaviour should be banned among schools and at homes and should be strictly punished, so that this will not be repeated next time. For instance- I saw an article in the newspaper regarding the young boy talking nonsense and using abusive language to an old man in public transport. Apparently, parents must control and educate the children in a viable way to respect elders and to make them learn what is good and what is bad from the early age.  Secondly, there has been appalling, indisputable facts recorded in recent times that school students are ragging their juniors and misbehaving with other students. In addition, independence and lenience have been given by the school authorities because of parents force which made students to misbehave. There is a saying that, having anything more than enough is not a good thing. Although many people think its parents responsibility to take care of their children, some people think its the technology and generation gap which plays a paramount role in changing children's lifestyle. For instance- parents can control the use of mobile phones and regular follow up with the school management can change the behaviour with good guidance.  To conclude, I am inclined to agree with the aforementioned statement that parents play a crucial role in any child's life, if they don't take good care and sparing some time from their busy work schedules, children are more likely to get into social problems unaware of what will happen to their future. Therefore, it's just not only parent's responsibility, but also teachers and the community surrounding them with good guidance making every individual as a good citizen of the country. ",8,8,8,8
,A lot of social problems can these days be related to teenagers. Some feel that this is because parents are not able to spend enough time and take care of their teenage child. Do you agree or disagree? ,"The number of teenagers impacted by social problems is on the rise. Many believe that the root cause of this is the inability of the parents to give time and support to their children. This essay will argue why despite the overhaul of social media and technology, educating children about social issues is completely the responsibility of the parents.  Today's teenagers face many social problems such as online bullying and body shaming. Some children are able to talk about them to their friends, teachers or relatives and get adequate support. There are also many social forums like support groups, grooming classes to name a few, which educates children about the current social problems and how to deal with them. For instance, schools have started to include a mandatory counselling for students of age group 12-18 years. This helps them to learn about the causes of these issues and ways to avoid them in a cordial environment. Because of these few reasons, many believe that teenagers are equipped to deal with social problems and take care of themselves.  Although, children have all the required support these days, but when it comes to discussing a problem or seeking advice, they still look up to their parents. Thus, it is the duty of the parents to take time out from their schedules and support them. Moreover, parents must indulge in activities with their children and foster their hobbies. A study by Harvard University suggested that teenagers who on average spend 6-7 hours per week with their parents have 40 percent less chances to suffer from any kind of social problems. These few reasons bolster the notion that it is completely the responsibility of parents to seek time for their teenage children and take care of their mental health.  To conclude, it is evident that no matter how many relatives or friends a teenager might have, nothing comes closer to spending time and talking with parents. Hence, I strongly agree that parents must put all their endeavor to spend quality time with their children and educate them about the common problems that teenagers face these days. ",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

I truly advocate that opinion of the value are changed completely than it used to. Because in today's world almost every people endeavour to receive high income, salary and benefit in order to improve their social stature which is thought the key factors of the up-to-date individuals' worth. For example, one of the most popular businessmen of the world that MC. Donald can easily deserve customer among a large number of heart, because of him a great amount of money and a high rate of situation. As a result, almost every person as I think a soul's worth can be measured by their a financial force.  On the other hand, although supports the kind of ideas which is a value based on finance would be sensible, it does not necessarily mean that all people think so. Since there are some who argue human's wealth may be not accounted via their social prominence or wealth. For instance, in India the intolerant, and kindness body will be admired much rather than the wealthy body. In that case this type of ideas may not be always true.  All things considered, I reaffirm that despite there are some the against considerations, in the developed living people consider that worth is high level degree of money and dignity. ",8,8,8,8

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? 1","It is true that people are judged based on their social status and personal wealth nowadays, and traditional values such as integrity and honesty are being forgotten. To a certain extent, I would agree with the fact that people are valued based on their wealth and status these days, but I also believe that old fashioned values still play an important part in our society. On the other hand, the advancement of technology in this digital age has led to change human's attitude and concept. One of the reasons this development is that media encourage young people to follow the wrong role model. They are misguided by the notion that a person should be wealthy and famous to be successful. They do not care whether the person they admire has character or integrity. They are blinded by the hype surrounding these people. Not surprisingly, a study conducted by a well-known university in 2016 revealed that 75% of girls aged between 14 and 18 years would rather be like Khloe Kardashian than Madam Curie or Mother Teresa.  However, the basis of being human is trust and kindness. Many things in life, the outside beauty, perfection is not the most important to the inner beauty and perfection. For instance, a vegetable at grocery store tastes bad, but high nutrient content, a book with the colourful cover page but boring and uninspiring. A beautiful woman with a perfect figure, but not a good choice for you to marry. If something on the outside has not defected, we are excited and believe it is the same on the inside. And then business people are still looking for business partners, who are reliable, can be trusted, and dependable. Therefore, it is important for adults to educate their children about these positive values because they still play an essential part in the societies.  In conclusion, even though people are judged based on their wealth and social status nowadays, but I do believe that old fashioned values such as honour, respect and trust cannot be eliminated from our daily lives. Therefore we must teach our young generation about these cultures, in order for them to epitomize. ",6,6,6,6

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? 2","It is often argued that, with the advent of urbanization and rise in economic standards, people are now no longer influenced by moral values. Personally, I am strongly convinced with this view. In my opinion, many people around the world now associate wealth with social prestige. In this essay, I shall examine a number of studies to justify the presented viewpoint.  To begin with, ever since the recent industrial revolution, television and mass media have played a crucial role in shaping our society. Media often portrait wealthy people as a significant role model, their assets and lifestyle are displayed as the symbol of luxury and success. Owning to this, a majority of the world's population, is now convinced that, a person's worth in society is now a measure of the owned assets. In order to achieve this fake sense of superiority, many people often buy products which are far above their affordable range. As a result, a majority of the world's population is overwhelmed by financial debts. For example, a recent study published by Oxford University illustrated that, people with financial restrictions and lower living standards, often feels isolated from their society and are more likely to experience mental distress.  In addition, many people often commit serious criminal offence such as credit card fraud, corruption, in order to keep up with the high profile lifestyles. This is borne out by a study conducted by the University of Melbourne which demonstrated that, more than 50% of credit card frauds committed are the result of their need to keep up with higher social standards  In conclusion, from the above stated reasoning, I am inclined to say that, people no longer value moral characteristic rather they are more fascinated by wealth.

,"A person's worth nowadays seems to be judged according to social status and material possessions. Old-fashioned values, such as honor, kindness and trust, no longer seem important. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? 9","Nowadays, a person who has the materialistic possessions and a high profile background are considered more important than how his values or personality traits are. I moderately agree with this viewpoint, as I believe a person's profile can make him powerful, but his inner values can only earn him respect.  An individual's characteristics such as honour, kindness and trust forms the basis of long term relationships; not only at present, but also maintains respect after his death. For example, The Mother Teresa; she is well known not for her material wealth, but for her generosity and the value of human life. The fame and status may seem worthwhile at the moment until one possesses money and or a post. When that is gone, no one will ever remember him. To exemplify, there are many such politicians who once were the face of their region or nation, however nobody remembers them at present. Thus, old fashioned values are essential to be alive in people's heart for a long time.  On the other hand, it is also true to say that people are attracted towards power and social status. No matter how well cultured one is, he can merely achieve success in the present world, unless he has some connection with high profile people. That is why, these persons with economic blessings and social status are considered as the very important personalities. They use money and power to achieve everything they desire, even get away with serious crimes. For instance, Nirmala rape case in Nepal, where the case could not move forwards, just because the accused was the son of some powerful politician. Undoubtedly, it is sad, even though it is a reality; a person's worth nowadays is judged according to his social position and property.  In conclusion, I moderately believe that these days someone is considered important if he has huge possession and position; meanwhile, I think to earn respect, we still need a good personality.

It is apparent that most celebrities today are admired or envied solely for their material wealth or status in various social hierarchies. Many of these people are known to turn their backs on friends, cheat on their spouses or spend their evenings - indulging in alcohol and / or drugs. Things like owning a mansion, driving an expensive car and getting into A - list parties are exalted above old - fashioned values. Ultimately, though, it is the gossip of many readers of magazines and celebrity blogs who reinforce these ideas, Nevertheless, I believe that in their day-to-day lives most people still believe in values ​​such as honour, kindness and trust. In some ways most of us want to form loving families, raise our children to be good citizens, stand up for the downtrodden and protect our communities from harm. We still form old friendships based on friendships, romances and business partnerships. When our trust is abused or we are unfairly treated, we see that as a major violation of our relationship and we judge the wrongdoer accordingly. In conclusion, I believe there is some truth to the notion that status and possessions have superseded old-fashioned values ​​as a measure of a person's worth. Looking beyond the tabloids, however, it is apparent that most ordinary people still have an old-fashioned conscience. ",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5
,"A person's worth nowadays seems to be judged according to social status and material possessions. Old-fashioned values, such as honour, kindness and trust, no longer seem important. 0","Social status, wealth and material possession have turned into the indicators to judge someone in the society these days while traditions, good quality and honour are no longer valued, though they are the de facto to judge a person. I agree that modern world has a completely different set of criteria for assessing or honouring a member of the society, though they are not the real elements to define a person.  Earlier, societies had some specific indicators to judge a man or woman. Among the judging indicators, they preferred qualities like honesty, kindness, trusts, honour etc. But with the change of time, such pointers have vanished. Unluckily the present society prefers social status or riches to judge anyone. A real-life experience may make it simpler. Recently, I closely observed a local election in a distant part of India. Among the two candidates - one of them came from a high profile background while the other one was a shabby man who merely had his own permanent living space in the locality. The majority of the people supported the first individual. They took him granted as a gentleman as he is enriched with material possessions. On the contrary, only a few people supported the poor guy. He was unable to spend bucks for the election but was competing on some moral grounds. He dreamt of changing the society. Unluckily he was defeated by the wealthy candidate. The rich man did not allow his opposition to be an obstacle to his success.  This triumph and defeat made me realise that material possessions are the key to judging as important in society. When people have enough riches to spend, they can buy social status and supports. But unfortunately, when someone comes up with humanitarian features, social elites term them as old-fashioned. They are ignored.  Therefore, I think such ideas should be changed. We should appreciate the humane features than social status and material possessions. Otherwise, the consequences will be detrimental. When the social status will be the indicator to judge oneself, I believe that would be too humiliating and may lead to massive social disorder.

It seems as though old fashioned values such as honour, generosity, and trust do not amount to much in today's condemnatory world. Apropos of the statement, I am in part accordance with it.  It is inarguable that a staggering number of people only consider about how their connection can bring advantages to them when befriending someone. For instance, one might think twice before making friends with someone who is kind but impoverished, as there is no benefit that is likely to stem from the connection. On the flip side, ingratiating with someone who displays ostentatious wealth might be more auspicious for one in the future.  Similarly, one from a wealthy family might feel hesitant to befriend someone who is struggling to make ends meet, seeing as the latter is not on the same level with one in terms of social status. Also, there is no guarantee that one will not be on the receiving end of bullying if one befriends someone of a lower status. Case in point, kids from my school will not let Jaycea hear the end of it because she is friends with Elaine, a driver's daughter, notwithstanding the fact that Elaine is trustworthy and dependable.  On the contrast, I also believe that it is unreasonable to stereotype the whole society based on the behaviour and way of thinking of some people. Like the aforementioned case in which Jaycea is willing to befriend Elaine despite being bullied, it shows that it is possible for some people to value trust and generosity over social status.  To sum up, while it is commonplace for people to hold a higher value of material possessions and social status in this overcritical world, there are also people who value old fashioned values more and they are not to be overlooked.

It is believed that we are living in the pop culture and materialistic era these days, as the public judge each individual based on his/her social status and wealth. It can be seen from how celebrities become famous nowadays. Many celebrities are being popular because of their physical appearance and personal wealth such Kim Kardashian. Her reality television program never shows any world class acting quality, but only shows about her luxurious mansions and fancy cars. And then there are other celebrities who are well known due to his/her social status as the son or the daughter of a wealthy family. One of the examples would be Paris Hilton. Although she has many bad attitudes, she is still popular because she inherits the assets of her parents.  Although traditional values such as respect others, being responsible, honesty and integrity seem to be forgotten nowadays, but they still play an important part in many communities. In common cases, employers are still assessing their potential employees based their hard working attitude, positive behaviour and their integrity. And then business people are still looking for business partners who are reliable, can be trusted, and dependable. Therefore, it is important for adults to educate their children about these positive values because they still play an essential part in the societies.

However, they are completely wrong.  In our technological world all of us forget what are the real values we should possess. We are thinking that our life is a competition in which we have no real friend who could trust so we behave cold, losing ours kindness.  The real problem though is that losing these values is a tendency by youngsters who are using their smartphones non-stop. Because it is a technology which made the world a material one. These young people would give the exact same example to their children so it would become odd if someone is kind or trusting.  I do not think that we realise the risks of being material. Even though it sounds like a cliche, it is true: Money can not buy you happiness. Yes, you would be pleased if you have a big house with a pool, some modern cars and a huge company but where is your big family? To be a happy, loved, honoured, kind and loving person does not require material possessions and a particular social status. It requires a big heart.  In the past people were divided into groups by their social status. These on the bottom of the pyramid were living a terrible life because the only thing they possessed were some vital values.  My opinion is that we should not go back in these times. The only change which is necessary is to ensure a good life for everyone - let's make the world a modern but a pleasant place.

","A group of individuals claims that the large of budget might possibly be considered as a tool to evaluate the values of a person rather than their characteristics. In my opinion, I completely disagree with the above notion since there are a number of aspects that people should highly appreciate to judge one's worth.  There is no doubt that various celebrities might not be paid tribute by others even though they possess a large of real states and cash. The recent studies reported that some of famous people could not be given the forgiveness from fans after serious sandals such as portrayed with lovers or treat others so bad and others. This could intensively reduce the number of followers on social networks and leave others a negative impression on those. As a result, celebrities might be overlooked and judged as a lower educated individual rather than being respectful because of their money.  Moreover, the well behavior and attitude could support people to reach to a new peak among daily routines and career. It is undeniable that employees who are more likely to treat kindly and give others the reliability might be appreciated much into the important position in an organization even though their account experienced a low-income in the bank. Since the characteristics of those could offer the satisfaction to partners and managers such as sense of honour and trust, staffs could easily convince others to follow the common vision and lead a team to achieve certain successes. To illustrate, Bill gate have been ranked as one of the most influent billionaires by his creation of Microsoft word in the whole world. Not only by personal achievements, he also was evaluated as a wise and charming person when funding much money to the charity and voluntary programs in order to help children be developed in a better living environment  In conclusion, I consider that the worth of individuals might be evaluated by different aspects rather than one's possession.

In my opinion, I consider, using mobile phones can bring more advantages than any bad influence it might cause.  On the one hand, those who believe that, mobile phones are evil, point out that, this can tarnish both family relationships and friendships. This is because nowadays, people's screen time has increasing; mobile phone users prefer to communicate with online friends rather than real life relationships. This, even causes problems in their workplace as well, due to lack of concentration, they may not be able to complete their assignments on time. Apart from this, because of the veil of anonymity, conversations in the chat rooms and discussion platform often offensive. Finally, sometimes this can be used to spread false information and propaganda to tarnish someone's life purposefully.  However, opponents of the above argument think that this abolishes the distances an I firmly support this. This facilitates people to interact with friends and relatives, who, even, live in the other part of the globe. Customers of mobile phones can access to the internet, where they can join multiple social media communities according to their interest. This also allows them to have constructive conversations with like -minded people. Many people regain their long -lost -friendships through this medium.

Before the rise of technology, family values were passed through generations. Now, children have open access to an excruciating amount of information and social media. The internet gives us a false impression that the person's worth lies on how much money they have and how they portrait their lifestyle online.  A direct effect of capitalism is measuring someone's worth by the amount of money they have. This culture tells us that it's more important to accumulate material belongings rather than investing in human connection. If we continue to devote all of our time to work, are we really living? Although we cannot aim to completely change the economic system we live in, we should think of better ways to live a happier and healthier life.  Social media is an amazing tool to bring people together, but it is actually bringing them apart. What is depicted online isn't the reality. One can post a picture of a perfect and wealthy life and be depressed and drowning in debt. To avoid those misconceptions, there has to be conscious use of technology, spend more time outdoors, having meaningful conversations away from your mobile phone. The scarcity of eye contact and human touch can be very damaging to our mental health.  Even though the way we live have dramatically changed over the years, deep down people are still the same. Human beings are wired to seek connection and are unable to live alone. Knowing that, there's hope that in the future we will learn how to balance every aspect of our life. That means that we will still pass down honesty, empathy and humbleness to our children, as well as teach them to look for it in everyone they meet.

However, I believe having an amusing personality, a kind-heart and being trustworthy is more significant.  These days, contemporary society is highly influenced by celebrities, who drive expensive cars, wear branded clothes and own a mansion. However, they are the ones who are drug addicts and abuse their bodies in different ways. Happiness which is directly dependent on materialism does not last long because these needs are never ending. Consequently, these humankind never get a sense of fulfillment, also never grateful for what they already have, this leads to depression and anxiety. For instance, A study published in The Times newspaper shows that 73% of famous public-faces go through anti depression treatment at least once in a lifetime. Thus, judgements based on someone's possessions are often incorrect.  Also for building good business relations, trust is vital and considered important by organisations before signing any deal. Moreover, money cannot buy everything, for example a good character or healthy relationships. While choosing friends or a life partner their personality traits are highly significant because no one can stay happy with an arrogant or negative personality. A survey published in a well-known magazine demonstrates that people who are intrigued by money are often depressed and lead an unhappy life.  In conclusion, It is true that our community is getting highly influenced by rich and famous celebrities. Nevertheless, I opine that money does not guarantee a good character or solid relationships.

The conventional value such as honour, kindness and trust, no longer held important weight in our culture. Some believe that financial status is the core factor in judging one's worth. I personally hold the opposite view, and my reasons are twofold.  First of all, there is a growing tendency in our culture that value materials gain a great deal. However, there is no shortage of examples that indicate many wealthy public figures have dysfunctional families. Such phenomenon reflects that material possession plays an insignificant role in one's family life. Some would argue that the most fundamental measurement to one's achievement is their relationship with their family, in which honesty and loyalty are required instead of money.  Secondly, culture as a whole is constantly promoting ill-advised images of celebrities and their expensive cars and mansions which reinforced such twisted value that financial gain is the ultimate goal of one's life. However, during times of crises and adversity, citizens often seek help from doctors, teachers and soldiers, which many are under-paid or paid an average amount of salaries. It is clear that their value to society is crucial, yet immeasurable by money.  In conclusion, I reaffirm my position that it is vital to promote the traditional value in our society. Although it is inevitable that money and material possessions have become increasing important to our daily life, honour, kindness and trust are still the fundamental codes of conduct, which are ensuring the prosperity of our society.

Our traditional values shifted as technological advancement took place along with globalization. As a result, our original values, that we hold to a certain standard, become blurry because negative influences were entering our nation from every way possible, either technologically or culturally. Furthermore, These developments helped improve the world economy. A lot of countries that were undergoing recession experienced a dramatic upturn in their economies. Thus, the idea that money can buy us happiness was born because having money was a rarity during that time. People would also believe that if they were someone of importance, their wishes would instantaneously come true, which was essentially accurate. For instance, someone who works in the government around that time would have easier access to numerous necessities.  In addition, social segregation becomes more apparent as the years go by. The distinct features of different social class are fairly visible. Consequently resulting in discrimination over those who don't belong in the same class. Individuals who belong in the higher social class hold themselves up to be superior than others.  Such thing can be seen in our daily life, like how students with a wealthier background will go to private school, whereas those who are not so fortunate will go to a public one  In conclusion, I agree that hitherto, our perspectives on the values that are important have definitely shifted for numerous reason.

I totally agree that ethics and values are very important in one's life and it shows the environment in which we bought up. In this essay, we will discuss both sides of the coin before any conclusion can be drawn.  Firstly, ethics and values hold great importance in life, both personally and professionally. Nowadays, people are being judged by their social status, instead of their values of life. For example, we Indians are very religious by nature, but in daily life we forget our values for little gains. Values are those acts we learn in our childhood from our parents and relatives. It means understanding other people's emotions and respecting their culture and lives. Also, no business and profession can progress without trust, values and ethics. All your degrees and certificates make no sense, if you do not know how to respect other people. Furthermore, good ethics and values depicts your country, culture and heritage. For example, Indians are famous in international countries for their customs and values, such as how we touch our parent's feet in the morning etc.  Secondly, some people think that no business and profession is possible these days, while maintaining old values and traditions. Young generation has failed miserably in preserving those old values. Some of the old traditions have gone obsolete and inappropriate in today's world and a new set of traditions should be created instead. Our education system plays an important role in a child's development and values should be taught to them in early stages. For example, it was widely held belief that students should respect their teachers, but now teachers can not even scold students for their mistakes.  To conclude, people with good values and ethics automatically attract people towards them. It shows that you belong to a good family and brought up in the healthy environment. It is truly said that the aim of education is the knowledge not of facts, but values. ",8,8,8,8

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? 7","In recent times, wealth determines the capability of an individual. It gives us an image that, human beings are assessed based on their riches and their prominence, rather than based on their essential values such as honesty and kindness as these seem to be far less necessary. I certainly agree with this perception wherein whopping finances determine the status of an individual. However, I have some hesitations in completely accepting it. This essay will discuss in detail about my opinion, which is slightly inclined towards the former.  On the one hand, human life is reduced to making money surreptitiously. Most of us dislike to acknowledge this phenomenon. Furthermore, the one who earns more, enjoys a monopoly over his business and so he is put on limelight for his repeated success over his rivals. He is considered as an inspiration for the rest of the youths to follow. His finances grow multi-fold with his name being spelled across all the global capitals. For example, Jeff Bezos became prominent ever since his company Amazon ruled the entire planet with virtual workspaces. His profits are more than that of the entire people's finances on the planet. Therefore, we tend to get attracted by such soft power rather looking at ingrained values.  On the other hand, there are several people who stick to their noble values such as kindness, honesty and integrity. For example, a company in South India had invented a way of converting plastic to combustible fuel in a legitimate way. However, their invention was arraigned and their ideas were stolen by people who want to make huge profits by selling the existing crude oil. Their intention was to maximise their profits by blocking the integral ideas and values. Therefore, honesty and kindness are considered as mostly dead. Thanks to the respiring judiciary, which gives us a bleak hope that these integral values are still appreciated.  To recapitulate, making skyrocketing profits or achieving stardom is a luxury which not all can replicate. We need to appreciate the way they made a success and imbibe it to our life, if it aligns with our moral values. However, by completely ignoring the legitimate values to achieve success will push us into an oblivion. ",8,8,8,8

On the other hand, the average employee with great solutions will not be given the same importance by the management. Although, most of the managers have no idea what the situation is about, still they chair the large meetings by copying the work of their subordinates.  However, on the contrary, the person with high values, kind behaviour and loyal personality is often deemed as suspicious within the society. Because of the materialistic mindset, truthfulness and other good traits are not given priority. Therefore, as a result, it decreases the morale of a kind hearted ones and it also forces them to put their entire focus on becoming rich. Thus, as a result, the overall environment gets deprived of the basic ethics and consequently, the country's economy face downfall.  In a nutshell, due to the fact that people are addicted to the sophisticated lifestyle, therefore, only countable assets are their only preference and those who lack these, are considered less important than others, who possess them.

Ans: Social status now a days become a status symbol to stand in the society. People will try to know about you if you have a material possession and good status in society. Time is laying a big role in this phenomenon. Having moral values, good cultures these are the personality traits of person which will remain with you long-life.  I strongly disagree with this statement that to stand in a society or to be a popular person you should have class. No, I believe this is applicable or fit only for the celebrities not for a common Man. A common man knows amongst people for his high values, his traits. Today's generation is smart enough to understand what is permanent and temporary. These materialistic things are temporary only but ethics, culture, moral values which you gained or earned from your Grandfathers it will remain with you thru your life, because what you learnt from your parents it's like a non-demolish able assets. Small- Small things i. e. our values, kindness, family, trust all are very much important you know a man by his behavior only and these all assets reflects in our personality whatever we are doing. In each activity a person can judge you what kind of personality you are.  Person having too much money, materialistic assets, property and luxurious life but all are waste if you don't know how to behave and treat a Guest or any stranger. so all these things are not long lasting, they can leave you any time in between of your life so only feel proud on your personality traits which makes you popular and fascinate others to come to you and talk to you.  A relevant and realistic example I would like to share - A girl after wedding comes in In-laws family, in her wedding, parents gave her so many gifts, too much money, materialistic and costly presents however they know these all are temporary and they are not lifetime but parents knows what are the beliefs, values, ethics, family culutures, love, trust they have given her it will be with her and help her to make her place in In-Laws house and heart of family members. A girl in that family will be known for her down to earth and genuine nature not for her dowry.  At last in Conclusion - A person is known for his simple living high thinking not for his materialistic things which are with him for a limited time period but the assets we have and our upbringing reflects how we behave in society that's matters a lot and in short by our behavior only we can influence other which will be permanent - ""first and last impression - stays forever in heart "".

In this essay, I will discuss each side and give my own opinion. Firstly, I will talk about accepting a bad situation and secondly, I will provide arguments for improving a particular situation.  People mostly tend to not take any risk in financial world or business as for them, it is their hard-earned money. In terms of risk, sometimes a long period EMI is taken or a loan for which they are bound to their work for long years and do not work in field of their interest, but for their bills and liabilities. Situations like this will make a person belive that fate is responsible for their financial doom and in addition to this, they will no longer take any risk or experiment new things in life, which ultimately leads to monotonous, vegetated lifestyle. Therefore, making them accept and get adjusted with their current situation.  In contrast to this, any situation or scenario, financial or personal, can be taken positively and a person may work towards it to make it better. For example, Elon Musk was fired from CEO position of Paypal when he went with his wife on honeymoon. At that time, he was a considerable shareholder and received millions of dollars from selling those shares. He could have easily settled in a big house with expensive cars ad do nothing, but, he decided to opt for a business, SpaceX, which is now one of the world's biggest space exploration organization. Thus, being able to take risk in life, a person not only improves the situation, but also gains experience.  In concusion, there is no need for a person to accept a situation and sit idly by when there are opportunities that can turn life around in seconds. In my opinion, people can manage their financial situation by just applying their brain and work towards a goal or project and take risk that is not conventional to society. Also, taking the risk may lead to failure, but we should never forget that Edison developed electricity in more than 900 failed attempts. ",6,6,6,6

They always seem to want what other children have. It is as though, they judge them to be, perhaps cooler, because they have the so and so toy. It is no different in older people.  Generally, a good suitor for marriage is judged to be ""good"" based on what he earns. It is as though humans have always been naturally judged by their possessions. However, I will not characterize honour, kindness and trust as old-fashioned. While these values are not actually worth money, they have always been the strongest basis of all of our relationships and life decisions. Therefore, I disagree with the above statement very strongly and this essay will explain why.  No matter how far we all go in terms of tech and modernization, every human instinctively respects these values. What happens to the filthy rich couple, when one of them cheats? The money and status do not help. And, if the other one decides not to forgive the infidelity, they end up making the biggest decision of their lives. While money, social status and material possessions are initially important to most people- they are temporary.  One of my closest friends got married to someone immensely wealthy, while she was in love with another person. The other person did not have much in life to offer to her but loyalty and commitment. Soon after, her husband got defrauded and his business went down the drain. What she prized the most was in fact temporary.  Conclusively, values such as honour, kindness and trust are not old-fashioned, they still for the ""code of ethics"" of the greatest companies in the world. Although not looked at initially, they will always stand to be the basis of long-term human judgement. ",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

Sadly, this statement cannot be refuted as we can see a lot of such occurrences, but still, I would say that this is not entirely true.  Most people today are intent on building up their social status and wealth, but there is still a general perception among the people to do deeds which are constructive to society. Even now, we are taught to be honest, kind and friendly towards our peers and fellow people in society. We thrive to make the right decisions and are fitted with a conscience, which can specify when there's something wrong in our outlook.  As with everything, there are negative sides to this argument and there are people to whom self-sustainability is the only priority. Such people don't value these old-fashioned attributes and their lives are prone to disorientation when something goes wrong. But, I would say that these kinds of people make up a very small, creamy layer in the entire populace. The other side of this coin is where you can see the larger section of the population in. These are people who focus on building good values and judge the other person based on their values. You can be a super-rich person, but to this populace, the amount of goodness and endowment to the society is what matters the most.  In conclusion, though, I wouldn't be able to refute the fact that there's a lot of materialistic selfishness there, they have not and will not overcome the goodness that is present in the world.

","In the modern world the worst of an individual is evaluated basing on see status in society and material possessions. At the same time, how did it values, including owner, kindness and Trust seem to lose their past importance. From my point of view, even though status and wealth became predominant in judging one's worse, old-fashioned personal values have not lost their meaning yet.  On the other hand, Society venerate personalities, who achieved success, possess power and respect. For example, during community events, such as dinners in formal ceremonies, people both consciously and unconsciously tend to pay attention to and ask him if he Nyan of those figures, who have highly paid positions in succeeding companies. Or, another example, is when personalities with impressive cash assets tend to have more attention and respect from media, government, and Society in general. Thus, it is not objective to refute the opinion that social status and wealth of a person play a key role in judging his value.  However, there is no reason to say that previously mentioned values eliminated the importance of being honorable, kind and trustworthy. When people choose their friends, they often put Humane header 3 sticks of the person to the first place. In order to overcome difficult unforeseen life situations one needs reliable comrade, who's kind hearts with enable him to empathize and support the friend in need. Hence, old-fashioned values such as owner, kindness and Trust are still important in determining one's worth.

","In this day and age, one is firstly determined by his social status and how many things he owns and his manner comes at the second. The reasons for this might be our modern society and our new way of thinking. In my opinion, indeed, old-fashioned values do not seem as important as it was.  First of all, modern society has created more modern values, such as one's possessions and success. For instance, as the phone business continues to grow, people have been spending more and more money on buying phones. People now will treat you the same as the value of that phone. Another example is whether you are successful or not. The only thing that they care about is how much money you have made, how many houses you bought, etc. Nobody will take into consideration your kindness.  Secondly, as time changes, our way of thinking does change, too. People nowadays mostly only know how to make profits and take advantage of other people. If they go on nicely doing their work, they soon will lose their money and then become poor. No one will ever respect them. Moreover, in this modern-day, you cannot trust anyone completely. You must always have doubts seeing that ""trust"" is no longer important.  In conclusion, nowadays, social status and one's success are more essential than trust, honour and kindness. The modern society, as well as our new way of judging other people, maybe the reasons that lead to this opinion. ",6,6,6,6

","In today's day and age, where we spend most of our time chasing wealth and material gains, I agree that a person's worth these days is mostly judged based on social status and material possessions. However, old-fashioned values such as trust, kindness and honour still play an important role in forging deep, meaningful relationships.  In my personal opinion, I think when it comes to first impressions, we do judge a person's worth by their material possessions and social status. For example, when we meet someone dressed to the nines, we instantly deem them as being good and worthy of our respect. On the contrary, when we come across underprivileged individuals or poverty-stricken individuals, we tend to look at the person in a different light.  A quick scroll through social networking sites such as Instagram, Facebook would prove the same. The current society worships celebrities and social media influencers such as Kardashians more than Noble Peace award winners such as Malala Yousafzai. These celebrities and social media influencers have thousands if not millions of followers. They are looked up to as role models and given platforms to share their views simply because of their wealth and social status.  However, when it comes to forging deep, meaningful relationships, we look past the social status and material possessions and old-fashioned values such as trust, kindness and honour are given more weight in determining a person's worth. We still expect our partner, family members, friends and community to be trustworthy, to be kind and to do the right thing. When we get to know someone on a personal level, we make values such as trust, honour and honesty the basis of the relationship. Additionally, even with celebrities and famous people, when the individual has wronged or acted in such a manner that they don't embody the right values and morals, society condemns the actions and judges the wrong doer accordingly.  To conclude, I believe that we only judge a person's worth by their social status and material possessions when we first meet them but as the relationship deepens, we measure the person's worth by their values and morals.

Kind and reliable people seem that are not important in our society anymore. In my opinion, this is not true in real life between real people, because it is a tendency of social media and television to focus more on appearance rather than on important values such as kindness and reliance on others.  Firstly, human relationships base their importance on trust between two people and it does not matter the amount of money a person earns or the number of cars somebody own. As a matter of fact, I do not think a man and a woman decide to pass their entire life without relying on each other. All in all, we choose people who can stand by ourselves in relation to love, confidence, kindness and importance they give us.  However, there is a portion of humankind that is unfairly growing which relates a person's importance with economical wealth and social status. As an example, social media such as Instagram or Facebook, are full of people trying at every cost to appear better than they are, in order to gain reputation and then money. In particular, they tend to show themselves near beautiful girls, nice cars and luxurious places, as if like money could buy anything a person wants.  In conclusion, even if social media have been strengthening the importance of appearance and money for years, I still think that dated values are tacit but always present, because they permit us to relate with other people, to gain a true social position which is reached without economical or showy means.

","Most of the people in this world calculated the person's value depending on the money Where as values which have been given importance in the olden days like virtue, truth, generosity is forgotten. In my Opinion a man can be judged based on his personality traits, but not on the material Possessions.  First, measuring a person's worth based on the qualities like social status and money is completely erroneous. For instance, we are not estimating our parent's based on the properties they have. As follows one cannot measure an individual's value depending on the belongings.  If we are eccentric about material gains then the world will become a bad place to live. Also as per the survey conducted by the Psychology department of John Hopskins University it's been releaved that many in the society given respect to rich has increased drastically in the last ten years from 30% to 50%. It shows how materialistic we are  On the Contrary, Some people argue that they are respecting the rich people because of the qualities they have. If this is the case, then it's acceptable to revere such kind of persons which are richer. For example, everybody in this globe respects Bill Gates due to his character and the accomplishments made by him. In the world there is a parity of respecting the general kind qualities and intellectual abilities.  The conclusion is, even though we should respect a person depends on the money he has, but it's not the only benchmark to certify a man's character. We can encourage the nice qualities in a generous human being, so that it will set an example for the children to follow in the shoes of the Kind man. ",6,6,6,6

As above mentioned a persons worth has shifted from its individual character to material possession, social status and so on. In the following essay I will give an general idea of current societies thoughts. Our current society is trying its best to cope with the current pace of trends. Globalization has increased a competitiveness in each persons out there, be it to become a successful employ or to be in the top of business, to get promotion in work place everywhere its a competition. As said by Dalton 'only survival of the fittest' and each individual has taken it to their heart. I personally disagree with the fact of judging a person solely based on their social status and possessions, because in the long run its not wealth or material things that matter, instead a person has to be charismatic and honest. I had seen a person who had all the wealth he dreamt of, but by nature he is wicked and cunning. Obviously for the short period he was admired and treated well by the society but due to an unexpected crisis he lost all his wealth and possessions, he was shown with with harsh reality of being lonely and no one even bothered to care about him. He lead rest of his life in misery and ended up in jail for commiting hinaous crime. The point of view of society has actually led many individuals to burry their values and focus on accumulating more wealth be it through straight or crooked way. I hope their will be a shift in thinking of the society in the coming year so that the future generation can lead a peaceful life and help each other develop true personality like understanding, trust, honesty. These traits will not give an individual true happiness but will make the people in their surrounding content and bliss. ",5.5,5.5,5.5,5.5

Some argue that people are getting respected based on their status in society and wealth at present. However, in past, everyone gave more significance to each other's belief and humanity. I completely believe that in today's world worthiness of a person is dependent on material wealth rather than innate qualities such as trust and humanity.  People who are rich materially and socially are given the first priority in the current day society. This is because in current scenario everything is functioning as result of money. Without money nothing is possible in today's society. For example, during the COVID times, people with sufficient amount of money managed to handle the situation. On the other hand, laborers who were working in other states were not given any attention. Consequently, they were made to walk thousands of kilometers to their hometown while nobody cared about them because they are not socially and economically stable. So, money is the main factor to save us in this modernized world.  Traditionally, people with humanity, trust and love were considered to be worth. People were less attracted towards money in those days. They considered one's character to be their important possession. To illustrate, everyone used to abide by rules in olden days and as a result corruption was very rare and everyone was self - disciplined. These things made everyone to follow certain principles in their life with good innate character. Due to technological development, slowly the society got changed and finally everything got corrupted.  To conclude, whatever the situation may be, one should not lose their quality of life to earn monetary wealth. Worthiness earned by money will last only for few days. Everyone should learn to respect others based on their innate god qualities. ",6,6,6,6

Nowadays, people obey the good personalities on daily activities such as trust between the others. So, I agree with this opinion who said that people nowadays are more be judged by their social and economic condition.  I believed that are some reasons why people these days don't think good personalities have more value than their social status. First, it is because the global transitions. Our world has been change so much if we compared to the past decades and it's include the changes of human thought. For example, in the past few years, we know the word ""hedonism and consumerism"". Those two words are famous these days and really represent our daily life. Because of this, people judged others from their material things like their fashion outfit or their smartphones and cars. The final effect of this statement is people do not think that personality is more important and valuable than material things. Second, it is because the social environment itself. Many people already thought that personality isn't valuable anymore and its influence others who is have the same environment with them. So they change their mind because of most of the people do it. By this I mean, they do not want to be called old people that's why they do it.  Although most of the people nowadays think that personality values don't valuable anymore, there are still some people who place personalities as their first priority. They thought that good personality is important thing on daily life. In some case, many company takes their employee personality matters. They do not want to hire a worker who have bad personalities.  In conclusion, most of the people thought that personality doesn't matters anymore because the world already changed much and it's called old fashioned.

For example, if someone has a lot of money and he does not share with anyone, that will be treated as a selfish and self centred person, that our society does not want. People neither like nor respect them. Take, for instance, celebrities who endeavour for charity get more admiration. For example, Bill gates is not famous, because he has money, in real fact he is renown due to his beneficent endeavour.  There are a lot of actor and actress who task for charitable institutions, and use their fame for future support in public. For instance, in my country in India numerous Hollywood heroes work for charity and give donations every year, therefore people like them because of their merciful contribution not because of wealth.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that money plays an important role for persons social standing, nut honour and kindness are still validating, in order to win the true love and affection of followers, celebrities would have to show their kindness and generosity.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. 6","The rich and the famous command greater respect in the modern society. In fact, values such as kindness, generosity and honesty are becoming irrelevant. Therefore, I agree with the argument that worldly riches and social standing have become the new measures of a person's worth. One of the reasons for this development is that the media encourage young people to follow the wrong role models. Also it has become difficult for ethical people succeed in this immoral world.  Youngsters these days choose the wrong people as their idols. They are misguided by the notion that a person should be wealthy and famous to be successful. They read about models, singers and actors having millions of followers on social media and want to be like them. They do not care whether the person they admire has character or integrity. They are blinded by the hype surrounding these people. Since they are always gazing at the 'stars', they do not get an opportunity to learn from the real heroes. Not surprisingly, a study conducted by a well-known university in 2016 revealed that 75% of girls aged between 14 and 18 years would rather be like Khloe Kardashian than Madam Curie or Mother Teresa.  However, this does not mean that people with principles have gone extinct. They are still around, but they cannot find their way to a position of power or success. More often than not we observe that the offices of power are held by rich and influential people who are morally corrupt. Youngsters who follow them on social media and elsewhere get the impression that the honest cannot succeed in this world. Consequently, they give up on their ideology and choose to tread the easy path that would take them to success.  In conclusion, values have certainly become irrelevant in the twenty-first century. This could be due to various factors such as the influence of the media, which constantly raves about the rich and the famous. Another factor that contributes to the demise of age-old values is the fact that honest and ethical people are struggling to succeed in this materialistic world. ",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

Decades ago, people used to consider the morality of the person as the most relevant aspect to determinate their value, but nowadays, the materialism has grown and people decide whether the person is valuable or not depending on what items possess and their socio-economic status. On my opinion, this should not be this way, and society must change the way they see people's value. I am going to briefly describe this opinion.  Everyday society is developing more of a sense of materialism, which is mostly instilled by advertisement and big companies which motivate us to create a huge value of stuff, as if this were a major aspect of our lives. Therefore, we purchase their products massively, reducing the importance of more valuable matters, for instance, people tend to be in their phones the most part of the day, ignoring the physical contact with members of their families or friends. In this respect, people are creating value in the area of media, technology, and popularity, for example, it is a common scenario that many people prefer to be friends of someone who has more followers and Instagram than to someone next to them.  This phenomenon has been growing over the years, and people are attributing material possessions and also online possessions (such as followers in a social media, in the former example) to evaluate a person's value. I believe this situation is sorrowful because we are losing close relations to preferring materialistic matters, leaving aside fundamental features in people, as loyalty, hospitality, kindness and many other qualities we should embrace more than superficial matters, as they provide us relationships with quality and affection, which I think is hugely more relevant for us.

To a certain extent, I would agree with the statement that materialistic possessions are the driving factor while making a judgment about a person, However, I also believe that we cannot completely ignore the importance of moral values like as Honesty, Integrity and the positive attitude. This essay will discuss both aspects of above notion and will provide the final opinion.  First of all, the current generation is more inclined towards materialistic world. Outer appearance, such as clothes, jewellery or costly possession like a luxury car or Gucci bag is valued more while making perception about any person. For example, many celebrities like Kim Kardasian are famous only due to their expensive outfits. They hardly display any world class acting skills in their TV shows. Secondly, some celebrities are sons and daughters of rich families. For instance Paris Hilton has inherited luxurious lifestyle from her family. Although she has a bad attitude, still she is very famous because she inherits the assets of her parents.  However, we cannot completely ignore the relevance of traditional values. An employer will always look for those employees which have strong personality traits such as honest behaviour, integrity and dedication towards their work. Morover, a businessman will always prefer to do business with the partner who values, ethical practices more than any fake work commitments. In other words, a person's worth is judged according to the behaviour and circumstances.  To conclude, the majority of judgements are still based upon the social status of the person. I opined that materialistic possessions play crucial role in determining individual's worth. However, we can significantly lessen this trend by teaching our young generation about their cultures.

To what extent do you agree or disagree. 3","The value of the people was measured according to their honour, trust and kindness until today. Unfortunately, this judgment couldn't proceed along. The quantity of the people depends to a place in society and personal property from the present. I can see both sides of this argument and I will explain my perspective with examples in this essay.  On the one hand, the given viewpoint is correct. As a reason is that, many people regard wealth as human dignity. According to their opinion the people can be valuable, only if they are rich and they have a career. There are a lot of people who fear humans, according to social status and material possessions. For example, the people who have own business and succeeded. Likewise, the individual who has a car and magnificent lodging or works in a high rank. Some foolish people tribute these kinds of mankind. Moreover, they appreciate and imitate to them. Nowadays we can see 60% of people whose viewpoint the similar with them. If they continue to think at this age, the true human value will be lost.  On the other hand, the people who appreciation others for their good character, honesty and benefaction are exist in our life. They think the most costly people should be very helpful and charitable. Because, they are important features of the mankind. For instance, the person who helps to others with moral and material support will receive their blessing. The needy men will never forget this aid, furthermore will regard and appreciate this benefactor. I think the number of these people will never disappear.  On the whole, there are two types of people whose opinions are opposed among them. But both of them right. The main reason is that, the people who judged the value of others for their honour, kindness and trust are subsist. Nevertheless, the people who judged for their property and social status are more than the first type of humans. Consequently, both of them are exist at the present. ",7.5,7.5,7.5,7.5

The other values which also plays a pivotal role of individuals prosperity and development are being useless. I totally disagree with this statement because, these all values are important and make humankind of good nature. This essay discuss the importance of social prestige along with the ethic values and end with reasoned conclusion.  On the one side, in nowadays lives of people is changing with a high pace, everyone has been busy in fulfilling their basic amenities. In addition to it, for achieving these, people do lots of efforts by means of striving so that individuals get pride and some respect from society. After this, their dignity plays a significant role for them to survive in the social culture. Sometimes, worth of people has judged on his reputation and work. For example, a recent survey had done in between the people and showed that the majority of people had been observed due to their good name and fame I: e wealth.  On the other hand, as human's worth plays an imperative role in growth of an individual, but there is an equal roleact of the key values in their life. In other words, these moral values like kindness, trust and honour helps to achieve the real success in soul. As a result, whole life becomes in a smooth way, if we could gain moral thoughts in live with hard work. Moreover, the aspects of life show the overall development of the people, that means physical and mental improvement makes balance in growth. Hence, old fashioned values necessary in everyone's life and these are have equal priorities in making the people wealthy.  In conclusion, it would not say correctly that people's income only judged by their condition and their body language. However, ethic values have vital in life, by this overall growth can be achieved. Hence, there is a better coordination between the hard work and these values, which in terms a real success.

,"Although more and more people read news on the internet, newspapers will remain the most important source of news for the majority of people. Do you agree or disagree? ","It is true that in the modern world people have a tendency to read online newspapers. While I believe that reading news on the Internet can bring people up to date with what had happened effectively, I also believe that printed newspaper is a better way to gather information.  On the one hand, there are several reasons why online newspapers are in preference to printed ones. Firstly, online newspapers can provide people with regular news updates. The latest news can be spread on the Internet at the time some events take place, as a result, users can quickly obtain up-to-date information. Take a football match as an example. The match score is updated only a few seconds after a player scored a goal so that people can catch up on the match easier. Secondly, online newspapers can lighten the financial burden for both readers and publishers. The publishers can reduce the amount of ink and paper to print the newspapers. Readers can get the news that is free of charge with their phones or computers instead of buying the paper.  On the other hand, it is wrong to reject the argument in favor of printed newspapers. Firstly, the papers can provide a major source of news of high quality. Each item of news is classified more carefully and thoroughly in printed newspapers than those on the Internet due to the money they cost. Secondly, reading the papers can remain a healthy way for readers to gain information. Reading news on the Internet over phones or computers can inflict damage to people's eyes while printed papers are harmless.  In conclusion, it is ludicrous to compare online newspapers with printed ones because they are equally important. ",6,6,6,6
,"Although more and more people read news on the internet, newspapers will remain the most important source of news. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? 8","In the present situation where many people read news online, it has been a debatable issue whether newspapers will survive as the most essential source of news or not. I totally disagree with the opinion because traditional newspapers lead to a waste of the woods and people do not trust them because of its corruption.  The main reason why I believe that newspapers will be useless is that publishing daily newspapers is wasting valuable forests. The environmental issue is increasingly serious nowadays; for example, the deforestation of vast rain forests in the Amazon, which can convert CO2 to oxygen, so they have contributed to global warming by converting less CO2 back to oxygen, has led to the increase of carbon dioxide emission, and it also led to a rise of sea level, and the drought in East Asia. Therefore, many people have started to perceive the importance of preserving the earth in a clean and safe state, and besides look for alternatives for the printed media.  Another reason why I support the notion that newspapers will disappear is that they have been used as an effective tool by people with power and money throughout history. In particular, from WWII, when the Nazis controlled German citizens with their detrimental propaganda, to the most recent case, when Chinese authorities hid the actual number of COVID-19 cases spreading around, the conventional media, especially newspapers, has been manipulated by governments. Consequently, people prefer to depend on SNS or the Internet, such as Twitter and YouTube in recent days.  In conclusion, I contend that the printed media will lose its influence in the future because the environmental issue is a worldwide trend and people are unlikely to believe newspapers due to their corruption. Given this situation, it seems that people should have a keen sight to differentiate true from false when they get new information from any source. ",8.5,8.5,8.5,8.5

","It is common these days to hear people talk about the rivalry between online media and newspapers. While some people think that traditional press will remain the most important source of news, I believe electronic articles and print newspapers will progress together to bring abundant news to the public.  On the one hand, I accept that traditional newspapers will not go out of business regardless of the burgeoning trend of online news reading. Firstly, many publications has always acted as the face of certain organisations throughout its long history, and the ritual of enjoying a daily newspaper with a cup of coffee in the morning has been instilled in many generations. Secondly, unlike digital media, people do not need to get online to read breaking news of their choice, and this is really a plus point in many ways. Take inhabitants in rural areas, where Internet is not something ubiquitous compared with urban areas, as an example - they remain happy to catch up with the latest news at local newsstands.  However, with more and more people from a wide variety of ages reading online news everyday, I believe media on the Internet has massive advantages to compete with traditional newspapers. The main benefit is its flexibility; correspondents deliver every piece of news 24/7 and anyone in the world can read the hottest headlines as long as they manage to get online. It is also difficult to refuse visual attraction of illustration from high quality images, sound effects and colourful animation attached with the central news. Another benefit of online news is its responsive capabilities which is supported by many social platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, et cetera. It means that after reading an appealing article, a news reader could see comments from other netizens or share his or her own opinion to the online community.  In conclusion, digital media on the Internet is increasingly becoming an essential source of the latest news for a large number of readers and I believe this electronic type of media will play as important a role as print newspapers have been thus far.

","Many traditionalists believe that many people have access to the Internet, however, conventional newspapers will continue as the major source of news. I totally disagree with this view.  The speed and convenience of the Internet in this digital age have led to the increasing popularity of online news. Firstly, the Internet is able to provide up-to-the-minute news as it happens, 24 hours a day every day. As long as 1 have my smart phone or laptop with me, 1 can connect almost instantly to the Internet, surf the websites and access the news of my choice across the globe. Secondly, more and more people now' have access to the Internet and this trend appears set to continue. The more widespread the accessibility of the Internet, the more people will come to rely on it as their new's source.  In contrast, newspapers have drawbacks which affect their popularity. One major disincentive of relying on newspapers as a news source is the cost. Competing with freely available news online, newspaper publishers are facing the reality of falling circulation figures. Some major American newspapers have now' introduced online versions alongside their printed editions in an attempt to arrest this trend. Another disadvantage of newspapers is the amount of paper consumed in their production. With growing environmental awareness, there is a body of public opinion, which rejects buying newspapers because this involves cutting trees and transporting them to paper mills. While this may not be a major factor at present, the environmental argument will almost certainly gain ground in the future.  In conclusion, I would argue that newspapers will continue to decline in importance, and more and more people will use the Internet to access the news. ",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

The two main reasons to support my opinion are, most of the people prefer are acquainted to the format of the newspaper and also, because the news found in the journal are more relevant.  The older generation which consists of more than 60 percent of the population at any time prefers to read newspaper mainly due to the format it has. This means most of the people who still mid to the old level depend on the newspaper to read on a day to day basis, as it is more comfortable for their eyes and also very easy to follow. To illustrate, the simple black and white version makes it easier for most readers to read, unlike the online news, which could be in various different formats and a colourful appearance which could be more disturbing for the older generation.  Another reason could be that the accuracy of the information published in the journal. The newspaper has well known journalists who share news which would be closer to reality. As newspapers tend to be a quite sensitive journal, the news getting printed on them are closely monitored, in order to avoid hurting the sentiments of people. However, as the internet is vast, so the news online cannot be monitored or censored, this encourages a number of wrong and incorrect information being circulated, a reason for fewer people relying on it. Hence, newspaper is considered to have more relevant content for serious readers.  To conclude, although with the development of technology a large population is shifting towards reading news online, however, this would not make the newspaper obsolete and they would still remain a good source of information for the traditional readers.

With the advancement in technology, nowadays people have easy access to the internet, therefore they can easily read the news on their mobile anytime in contrast to traditional paper when you have to wait for the newspaper.

Perhaps, people can discuss their views with others if they have some different views, that makes it is getting popular medium for news.  Finally, one of the most paramount reasons is that it is eco-friendly, nowadays the environment become a hot subject for all, so it is better we all have to move to an online medium to save the environment. I read in one of the magazines that newspaper is the one main source where most papers have been used, so if we want to save our environment then need to reduce the paper use as much possible so does not have to cut more trees.

Still, there are few people cannot read the news on the internet because of the language problem and difficulty in accessing the internet. For example, some people can understand only their local and native language. Since most of the content on the internet is in English or translated into the national language of the country, people who know only their local language will not be able to get information on the web.

The newspaper has remained the most important source of news for several decades and some people believe that it will remain the most important source in the future as well. The people behind this believe are mostly from generation X (older people). There are several reasons behind this thought. Firstly, older people have traditionally bought the newspaper over the years and still prefer to read the newspaper. Secondly, older people are less familiar with the latest technology, which hinders their use of electronic sources. Thirdly, the newspaper also includes other entertainment material such as magazines and crosswords.

So the internet provided us with news far easier and faster than before.  Moreover, following news on the net is more environmentally friendly than reading newspapers. Annually, a great number of the trees is cut to produce paper for newspaper publication. The less the newspapers are read and subsequently published, the fewer number of trees is cut for such purposes. So more forests are protected which is an environmentally friendly measure.  On the other hand, some believe that the newspapers are more reliable than online news. The news published in a newspaper is acknowledged by some professionals at newspaper office before publication, while there are a significant number of false messages and rumours on the internet which confuses people. So people can trust the accuracy of the news in newspapers compared to online news.

Nevertheless, it is my firm belief that the internet has many advantages newspapers do not, and will therefore replace the majority of them.  In the first place, it is important to consider that every newspaper article can be found online. Each media service such as BBC, The New York Times or The Guardian has their own website in which they post all the latest news. Such articles have the same sources as those printed in newspapers, guaranteeing the reliability of the uploaded material. For instance, should readers choose to search for news online, they would certainly have the option to access multiple platforms which lead to a variety of different opinions. Additionally, searching for a specific article online is faster and easier than going through the pages of a newspaper, due to the ability to look for them using keywords or filtering specific topics.  Furthermore, it is not only faster to access to news online, but it is also cheaper. The grand majority of news websites such as BBC news are free, although there are others like The New York Times, which ask its readers to pay for a subscription before they can access all the featured content on their site. However, the latter might still be better than buying a copy of the newspaper. According to Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy, each copy of the New York Times cost $2 for each Monday through Saturday edition, while each Sunday edition cost up to $6. This leaves a total of $18 per week, which is relatively high compared to the monthly subscription of $16. 99 offered by the same print on their website.  In conclusion, it is foreseeable that the internet might replace newspapers in the near future due to the advantages it offers that the latter cannot. It is safe to say that using the internet as a main source of information gives readers the ability to navigate through different sources as well as choosing better and cheaper options to spend their money on if they so desire.

So, this a journal also comes with other supplements, such as magazines and television guides and sources of entertainment such as crosswords.  However, though newspaper may not disappear completely, the internet is likely to become the dominant cause of news over time. This is primarily because younger people tend to read the news online and prefer not to pay for it, so those reading newspapers, the older generations, will gradually decline. This links in with the second reason, which is that as media companies start to see a drop in income from newspapers, printing them will become unprofitable and they will be forced to find ways to make money from news online. Plus, the audience, with an internet-connected device, is allowed to access news under the form of video clips, which are by no means available on newspapers.

,"Although more and more people read news on the internet, newspapers will remain the most important source of news. To what extent do you agree or disagree? 5","Even though there is a rapid increase in the number of people who read news online, another important part of the worldwide population considers traditional newspapers to be a more reliable and important information source. However, it is my firm belief that the internet has many advantages newspapers do not, and will therefore replace the majority of them.  In the first place, it is important to consider that every newspaper article can be found online. Each media service such as BBC, The New York Times or The Guardian has their own website in which they post all the latest news. Such articles have the same source of information as those printed in newspapers, guaranteeing the reliability of the uploaded information. For instance, should readers choose to search for news online, they would certainly have the option to access multiple platforms which lead to a variety of different opinions. Additionally, searching for a specific article online is faster and easier than going through the pages of a newspaper, due to the ability to look for them using keywords or filtering specific topics.  Furthermore, it is not only faster to access this information through the internet, but it is also cheaper. The grand majority of news websites such as BBC news are free, although there are others like The New York Times, which ask its readers to pay for a subscription before they can access all the featured content on their site. However, the latter might still be better than buying a copy of the newspaper. According to Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy, each copy of the New York Times cost $2 for each Monday through Saturday edition, while each Sunday edition cost up to $6. This leaves a total of $18 per week, which is relatively high compared to the monthly subscription of $16. 99 offered by the same print on their website.  In conclusion, it is foreseeable that the internet might replace newspapers in the near future due to the advantages the first one offers that the latter cannot. It is also safe to say that using the internet as a main source of information gives readers the ability to navigate through different sources as well as choosing better and cheaper options to spend their money on if they so desire.

,"Although more and more people read news on the internet, newspapers will remain the most important source of news. To what extent do you agree or disagree? 7","It is common at the present time to see people getting updates on the latest news from the internet rather than the traditional method of reading a newspaper. I would argue that electronic sources of news will gradually replace that of the journal.  Newspapers remain an important source of news for several reasons. The first of these is that the older generation still prefer to read their news this way, which is because they have traditionally bought a newspaper over the years and so do not wish to change or simply do not know how to do so online in some cases. In addition to this a journal also comes with other supplements, such as magazines and television guides, and sources of entertainment, such as crosswords. This makes it more attractive for some than going online.  However, though newspapers may not disappear completely, the Internet is likely to become, the most dominant source of news over time. This is primarily because younger people tend to read the news online and prefer not to pay for it, so those reading newspapers, the older generations, will gradually decline. This links in with the second reason, which is that as media companies start to see a drop in income from newspapers, printing them will become unprofitable and they will be forced to find ways to make money from news online.  In conclusion, although newspapers remain popular today, they will gradually be replaced by the desire to read the news through electronic sources. This may be a sad loss given their history, but unfortunately it is an unavoidable development. ",8.5,8.5,8.5,8.5
,"Although more and more people read news on the Internet, newspapers will still remain the most important source of news. Do you agree or disagree? ","The widespread utilization of Internet has revolutionized the way people read news, meaning that, they increasingly go online to obtain news. Despite this popularity, it is argued that newspapers will not fade in importance and will still be a common source. I partially agree with this opinion and explain why in the following paragraphs.  Today's digital era has made all sorts of information, including news, accessible online. Everyone now is trying to read online news on the Internet, because this mode of obtaining news is more interactive and richer in content with videos and sounds provided on websites. Another point in favor of e-news would be their accessibility. For example, if one was waiting in a long queue or else in a coffee shop for somebody, simple access to the Internet would provide comforts of reading online news rather than searching for a newspaper.  However, newspapers are effortless for people; they can easily read paper-based news without the need to go online and searching for particular websites, such as CNN or BBC. In addition to this, paper-based news pass through editing multiple times and huge publisher companies are held largely accountable for the content they provide in their articles. More specifically, reporters collect up-to-date information and editors check this several times before allowing it to be published. This will, in turn guarantee reliability of such news. Ultimately, stating that newspapers will lose their significance is to ignore the traditional and more conservative members of society who are less computer-literate; this is particularly true for older people.  By way of conclusion, although the number of people reading e-news due to their accessibility and interactivity is increasing at a rapid pace, I believe that paper news will still be considered as important. This is because, reliability and personal preferences to read such news will be of equal significance as online news. ",6,6,6,6
,"Although more and more people read the news on internet, newspapers will remain the most important source of news for the majority of people. Do you agree or disagree?","In the modern world, obtaining news on the Internet has become an accelerating trend. I have faith in the likelihood of this trend overshadowing the traditional way of reading newspapers to become the most crucial source of news. The most obvious proof supporting my viewpoint is the decline in the popularity of traditional newspapers. Conventional newspapers' nature is characterized by a thorough and time-consuming process of editing, printing, and distributing. This turns out to be a weakness that causes newspapers to fail to meet the instant quest for news of modern newsreaders. In addition, due to the fact that printed newspapers are geographically limited, their reach and exposure levels are be becoming substantially lower than those of online news. Apparently, it is online press, not the traditional one, which helps news seekers all over the globe access local news as well as global news published by a variety of internationally prestigious newspapers including BBC, New York Times, and Wall Street Journal. Such availability of online news far outweighs that of printed news, steadily dominating the news industry.  Moreover, the advantages of online news significantly surpass those of printed newspaper. In this era of advanced technology and communication, the omnipresence of the Internet and the availability of Internet devices have boosted the popularity of online news to the extent that the concept of buying and reading a printed newspaper would become obsolete and inconvenient. Online platforms which facilitate fast-moving and immediate news updates will certainly become the utmost solution to satisfy increasing demand and busy news seekers. Thanks to Internet-based platforms, news about an incident happening half the world away could be retrieved within a few seconds after its commencement, which renders news updates one day later on conventional newspapers out of date.  In conclusion, despite the fact that printed newspapers still hold an important role, I firmly support the tendency that they will be eclipsed by online news. ",6,6,6,6
,"Although more and more people read the news on internet, newspapers will remain the most important source of news for the majority of people. Do you agree or disagree? ","It is true that a growing number of people are using the Internet in order to find out the latest news. While newspapers are still popular, I strongly disagree that most people will continue to rely on them as a source of news.  The first reason for my view relates to the increasing use of the Internet around the world. Today, a growing number of people have access to online news via technological gadgets such as smart phones or tablets, so they do not need to buy a newspaper to obtain news. Even in more remote corners of the world, access to the Internet is becoming more widespread and the online community is growing daily.  Secondly, online news is always up-to-date while printed news needs time for editing, printing and delivering. In this fast changing world, readers tend to expect updated information about what has just happened or is happening around them. Online news can be broadcast immediately with vivid pictures and relevant stories, making it more appealing to readers than printed news.  Finally, the Internet is a repository of information for people to dig for information that they need. Digital information can be stored in mass quantity, which allows internet users to search for events that occurred in the past. In contrast, newspapers are generally hard to preserve because of the corrosive effects of the environment and their sheer bulk makes storage difficult. This once again confirms the edge of online news.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that the Internet is even now replacing newspapers as the principal medium for accessing all the latest news.

,Although more and more people read the news on the Internet newspaper will remain the most important source of news for the majority of people Do you agree or disagree with that statement ,"By the end of the 19th century, and the beginning of the 20th century, the newspaper industry with the advent of the New York Times, has grown tremendously and played an important role in providing news to readers. But nowadays, in my opinion, the development of online newspapers in particular, the internet in general, brings many new aspects to journalism.  First and foremost, online newspapers have the ability to store huge information, whether old or new. And with the presence of the Internet around almost every corner of the world, people with a portable device such as a mobile phone can get access to huge storage of news. Therefore, readers want to look up, learn about events, news that happened for a long time ago is completely possible to perform by simple operations. By contrast, with prolonging procedures including editing and printing, a traditional newspaper might not be able to compete with the Internet in terms of updating speed.  In addition, high interaction is an indispensable advantage of online newspapers and makes an important contribution to the transmission of information to readers. The electronic newspaper not only offers articles by journalists and reporters but also immediately receives feedback from readers through the comment lines under each reader's article. It can be seen that the online newspaper is a public forum that journalists and readers can exchange and share frankly about a problem in society. This is a feature that traditional (printed) newspapers cannot do and is only one-way interaction to people: reading.  The ultimate advantage of online newspapers is that information from around the world is updated regularly. Meanwhile, the printed press is limited to a certain area and scope and is difficult to update.  And the best advantage of online newspapers is that people will not have to spend money on buying monthly newspapers.  In conclusion, I disagree that the printed newspapers would continue to be the most crucial ( greatest) source of information because the more people turn to online newspapers for its benefits, the more difficult the traditional newspaper is",6,6,6,6
,"Although more and more people read the news on the internet, newspapers will remain the most important source of new. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? ","In the present situation where many people are searching for news on Google, it has been a debatable issue whether newspapers or broadcasting can remain the most essential means of conveying information or not. While some people agree with the above opinion, I personally contend that conventional newspapers will disappear in several decades with the following two rationales.  To begin with, the development of technology has accelerated the process of transmitting information between providers and consumers. For instance, nowadays, it is almost impossible not to witness people with no mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and Macbooks. While we could only use the rudimentary type of cell phones in the early 20c. And the change has reduced the distance between news and viewers; people can speak and communicate in real-time even if there was an accident a couple of minutes ago by using YouTube live or something similar. Everybody is able to become a reporter or a viewer, and I believe that is a revolutionary alteration.  Another reason I find the upheaval more reasonable is that conventional newspapers have been manipulated. To be specific, from WW2, when Nazis spread their malicious, detrimental and manipulative propagandas, to the recent cases, when Japan regime is controlling official broadcasts to hide the truth of an enormous amount of nuclear emission in Fukushima. The prime minister, Abe, mentioned 'everything is under control, ', and the official, private broadcasts have never questioned regarding the issue against the government. Likewise, traditional news is likely to be used as a powerful tool for people who have money and authority; therefore, people have been finding a better way to replace outdated means.  In conclusion, while some people believe that conventional news will continue in the future, I am convinced that newspapers and broadcasts will be disappeared in several decades because the power of technology is strong enough to address the corruption across worldwide media.

,"Although more and more people read the news on the internet, newspapers will remain the most important source of news for the majority of people. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? ","There is no doubt that news reading has become increasingly popular over the past few years. Many people believe that while the internet has become a major source of news, newspapers will always be the best place to know what is happening around the world. This essay will discuss why I disagree with this viewpoint.  Firstly, most newspaper organizations are developing and maintaining electronic news websites in order to reach more and more people. Since most people are maintaining electronic devices where they can find hundreds of online resources to know what is happening around them, many of them have lost interest in reading newspapers. For example, in India, many newspaper publishers have stopped publishing newspapers as their business went down because of advanced technology. In contrast, even though some critics argue that many older people still depend upon newspapers as they are not aware of online news, I believe online news readers outnumbered these elderly populations.  Moreover, more and more readers are concerned about the price of the newspaper. This is because nowadays the internet connection cost is cheaper than many newspapers in many countries. For example, in Japan, the internet connection price is 15 dollars per month, while the newspaper cost is around 20 dollars a month. While some people argue that newspaper companies offer annual discounts, I think the internet assists us in many ways besides reading online news.  In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that newspapers will still be the best place to find the news even though more and more users prefer to read the news online because of online news websites and newspapers being more expensive than the internet. Therefore, I suggest newspaper companies to stop their publications and put more focus on developing online newspapers. ",8,8,8,8

Do you agree or disagree?","The amount numnber of people using the internet has recenntly increased massively thoughout the world, which means the traditional newpapers are facing to the huge rival. I personally believe that the internet news will be soon as important as traditional press. On the one hand, quite a few people believe that the traditional newpapers plays an important source of information despite of technology evolution. Firstly, reading newspapers is the easiest way to approach information because not everyone in the world able to access the internet especialy in rural areas. Secondly, the old or elderly people who are not good at using the computer tend to read news as a traditional way. In addition, the quality of internet news sometimes are not reliable. This means that there are a great deal of editted sources in the internet have not been verified, leading to the confusions for readers. Howerver, the internet are more likely to become popular as traditonal press for some reasons. The first reason is that the internet allows us to update a variety of different comunications anytime wherever we are by using the smart phones or devices. It means that reading new on the internet is not only save your time and also more convienient. Another reason is that the internet could brings the chance to share news to others, give their own opinions. For example, facebook and twitter are two popular platforms that everyone usually post and update information. Finally, online press might help us to protect the environment by reducing the raw material for papers prodution.

","Some people believe that newspapers will still maintain its popularity as the most important source of news, despite the widespread use of the Internet nowadays. I completely disagree with this opinion as the majority of people today neglect newspapers and use the Internet instead.  The use of newspapers has witnessed an undeniable decline in recent decades. Despite being extremely popular in the past as the sole source of news, newspapers do not possess the same influence and popularity as they did in the past. People started losing interest in them when the Internet was invented. For example, the only readers of newspapers in the twenty-first century are the elders who grew up reading them. However, these elders are being taught how to use the Internet by their grandchildren and are also losing interest in their beloved newspapers.  As the Internet is becoming more accessible to the public, an increasing number of people are leaving newspapers behind. The main reason for this is the wide variety of topics and news that the Internet contains and the easy accessibility to them. For instance, if an individual is interested in something, they can simply type whatever topic they have in mind into a search engine and find millions of articles on that topic. Furthermore, the news on the Internet is updated frequently, as opposed to newspapers that are daily or even weekly. Additionally, most newspapers contain local news, while the Internet contains news from over the world.  To conclude, despite some people arguing that newspapers will always remain important to the public, the vast difference between the number of Internet users and newspaper readers speaks volumes about the popularity of the Internet as opposed to newspapers.

,An increasing number of people are buying what they need online What are the advantages and disadvantages for both individuals and companies to shopping online?,"The number of people buying products online is rising. The advantages of this practice among both companies and customers can be obviously found, specifically in a large busy city. Meanwhile, some companies and customers think it causes a negative impact on themselves too. In my essay, these two views will be discussed.  On one hand, shopping online is considered to be an effective and convenient way for people to manage their time while they are living busy lives. For example, my university friend's father is a doctor and he always finishes his work after the closing time of a supermarket so he decided to buy products he needs in daily life, such as shampoo, instant food online.  For companies, selling products online can help them develop their product since they can access the need of customers by considering their reviews on the product. Currently, a number of official brand websites provide a comment or review box under the product details so that customers who bought the product can share their opinion on it. Through looking at comments from customers, companies can easily improve their product quality, thus increase customer needs for their product.  On the other hand, buying good online is likely to be risky for individuals because they cannot know the condition of the good while it is being shipped. To illustrate, when I read comments written by buyers on the shopping online website, I saw many comments complaining that the product was in a poor condition because it was not rapped properly.  Meanwhile, companies may face difficulty selling their good to people who do not primarily use the Internet. For example, companies selling energy drinks, whose targeted customer is people working for building construction, might lose their profit if they sell their product online rather than in convenience stores.

What are the advantage and disadvantage for both individuals and companies to shopping online. ,"People have different perspective regarding online shopping. Because of increasing demand of consumers there are a lot of profitable companies nowadays. Although some buyers and business enjoying the benefits of shopping online, others facing negative experiences.  Firstly, one of the good reason of buying online is convenient of costumers. All things that you possibly needed was posted in front of your laptop or mobile phones. People don't need to be stress in facing crowds in shopping mall or traffic in order to buy something. It takes only few hours to browse in internet then purchase order. After that it conveniently deliver to you without hassle. And for some companies this are beneficial. For example, they don't need a big capital to start business and manpower to help them. Since its online, they just need to upload the picture of their product for marketing. Less worker and more convenient. For instance, your place is far from shopping center, less worry because its easy for you to shop and less costly. And for the companies its accessible for them to showcase their product not only limited to one place but even to many places that they can thru social media.  On the other hand, due to growing online consumers most of the companies gained a good profit on their business. But one of the negative impact, they are not an environmental friendly. According to latest research about online shopping, they're using more plastic bags for packaging compare to shopping center that promoting eco-friendly bags to use instead of plastic. For example, if you will buy three products online they will pack it separately, whereas in shop these can be put together in one bag. Another possible problem is, buyers tend to be more impulsive. Because of accessibility of online shopping the costumer buy more products than usual. This will result of increasing number of people having addiction of buying things even its not necessary.  In conclusion, online business are both beneficial to consumer and companies. However, there are also consequences to be aware of. ",6,6,6,6

On the first side, online shopping is indeed convenient. Customers do not need to go outside to shop, they can purchase anything simply with a few mouse clicks from the comfort of their houses. Furthermore, online shopping allows people to select from a wide range of products, and the prices and features are often compared enabling customers to choose the right products that suit their needs.

The fact that online shopping encourages us to buy things that we do not need or use cannot be denied. This can lead to debts. Also, there are security concerns. When we buy things online, we run a small risk of getting our financial information exploited by hackers. There are some disadvantages for the suppliers also.

What are the advantages and disadvantages for both individuals and companies to shopping online? ,"Nowadays, computer technology has replaced many of the traditional methods and one of them is borrowing books from libraries. I completely agree that maintaining public libraries is not an effective method of utilizing the money as people have moved to the e-books.  Firstly, people are too busy to go to the library and borrow books, which led them to rely on e-books. For example, a study conducted by Oxford University in the Cannimara Study Central in Chennai, states that, only 300 books have been borrowed over a period of 6 months in 2019, whereas the count was 4730 in 2002. This drastic change is the result of the availability of the internet to all the corners of the world, because of which, anyone can download and read any content they want.  Secondly, there is a plethora of fund involved in keeping a library running, which involves the rent of the space, electricity, staff members' salary, etc. . These costs can be cut when we migrate to a computerized library model, where one person has to be employed and all the e-books can be uploaded to the website, where people pay and download the content. However, thiss cannot replace the experience of reading a real book- it cannot give the emotional-connect with a book. On the other hand, people can escape from carrying the books everywhere, as these e-books can be read in their mobile phone or tablet.  In conclusion, there will be initial hesitations and discomfort when we adapt a new technology, but in a few years, people will get used to the new trend. In a couple of years, borrowing books, going back to return would become old fashioned when computers give them flexibility in time, place and abundant options to read in just one click.

On one hand, shopping online provides a number of advantages, one of which is that online stores often offer lower prices than offline ones. For example, a toy biulding machine is twenty percent cheaper on Amazon than at Walmart. Moreover, buying online can help you to stay healthy because it allows you not to leave home, minimizing your chance to get infected. This is especially valuable over the period of widespread pandemias, such as coronovirus. Alternatively, if you go to a mall, you can become ill, and in this case you will be isolated for 2 weeks.  On the other hand, shopping online has negative consequencies; for example, it harms local economies because small stores which cannot compete with e-commerce services have to close. As a result, people lose their jobs, and the economy of a community suffers. In addition to that, people buying online often spend more time at home than those who should go outside to buy goods at offline stores, thus they less talk to others; as a result, they feel more stressed. Otherwise, if they bought products at local shops, they would support the local economy and would feel better.  In conclusion, taking everything mentioned into account, we can argue that although shopping online can reduce the costs on buying products and lowers the chance to get infected by various viruses, it harms local economies and makes people feel more stressed.

However, there are some pros and cons of this trend. This essay will discuss both the views in the subsequent paragraphs in an efficacious way.  To commence with, there are numerous benefits of online shopping. Primarily, it is time saving activity. Unlike the traditional shopping, there is no need to visit the stores for even small items. Purchasers can browse online what they need and place the order online to receive the particular product at home. To demonstrate, individuals just have to open the shopping site and it will provide them a variety of brands and new products, from which they can select accordingly. In addition, online sellers do not have to bargain with people for reduction of amount from an item. Moreover, online shopping sites available at the every corner of the world and provides 24/7 service. There is no time restriction on visiting the shopping sites for buyers. A person might place order anytime and from anywhere. For instance, numerous western people demand for asian style clothes, and they could use online shopping sites to browse the products online as per their requirement.  On the flip side, there are a few drawbacks of online shopping. Firstly, lack of personal contact among consumers and businessmen. Hence, goodwill is not generated due to online shopping. For example, there are more chances of fraud, because the sellers are unknown to the ultimate buyers. They do not have to meet with them, causing online trading. Furthermore, the traditional shopping is affected due to online shopping trends. The customers prioritise online shopping, and does not like to waste their time on visiting the shops for even a single item. To illustrate, traditional sellers who have no knowledge of creating the sites are having losses due to online shopping. Additionally, online sites are not always realistic.

One of the most important benefits that online shopping has provided lies within its definition, that is, anyone can purchase anything within a few minutes. The purchased goods are delivered door to door and so there is no need for an individual to go and buy. It allows consumers to select the items they want from a wider range of products as goods are available from multiple vendors. Another advantage is that more employment opportunities have been created for both skilled and unskilled labour. For instance, skilled labour, such as engineers etc. , are employed for maintaining and improving the services of the e-commerce sites and some of the sections of unskilled labour gets employed as delivery partners. By putting the products online for purchase, the seller companies and local vendors get the benefit of better sales and revenue.  However, like every coin has two sides, online shopping has some disadvantages as well. Because now multiple things are available just at one click, people are encouraged to buy stuff they do not actually need. Some studies show that the chances of the person to become a Shopaholic have been increased by 20 percent with the introduction of online shopping. Another disadvantage is that there are chances that a person will not like the product that has been ordered for multiple reasons such as colour is different or the quality of the product is not up to the mark. Thiss causes mental stress to the consumers. The sellers on the e-commerce sites have to pay them with certain amounts for each order and hence, there is the decrease of the profit. Multiple goods available for sale online are fake, but there is no way to check the authenticity of the product before purchase.

Purchase some time do not find the product reliable and decide to return back to the seller.

There are some advantages and disadvantages to this rising trend. Therefore, this essay will plead some pros and cons of this changing behaviour of people in the ensuing paragraphs.  The prime advantage of buying over the web is that it is apprehensively time saving. Due to this convenience of buying the people prefer to order from home in recent times. For instance, the food delivery is an evident example of time saving; which can be ordered using the internet and is delivered in the short span of time even for huge gatherings. Moreover, another good pro is the comparison of the prices from different sellers. With the latest technology available, comparing the prices is a no wonder these days.

For example, it is often experienced that the products bought online differ in the quality which actually appeared in the picture.

What are the advantages and disadvantages for both individuals and companies to shopping online? 8,"It is becoming increasingly popular to shop online, but although online shopping seems more convenient, there are disadvantages to replacing the traditional retail store. In this essay, I will address some of the pros and cons about buying over the Internet.  One of the main advantages of purchasing online is the potential cost saving. Since online shops don't need physical locations and many employees, labour costs are driven down, thus transferring these discounts to the final product price. Amazon is one of the largest companies in the world, that started out selling books ultimately converting into a multi-billionaire operation across the world. Furthermore, when buying online at Amazon, the consumer has access to a marketplace with multiple vendors. For example, they can review their purchasing experience, in this way Amazon gives customers the freedom of choice.  In spite of this, local stores are the support of many families and online shopping can hardly replace human interaction. If a retail store closes down, many families cease to receive an essential income, even if the family is provided with a severance package. Therefore, retail stores need to overcome the risk of becoming obsolete, because people prefer to have everything easy rather than having to make an effort to get it. Take for instance, Circuit City, a large technology retailer that had to file bankruptcy in the midst of global takeover of online retailing.  In conclusion, people are shopping online because of its practicality, in addition to this, many are finding cheaper prices in the Internet stores and fast-shipping inventory. On the contrary, there are a number of companies lagging behind and being unable to innovate in this modern era. ",8,8,8,8

What are the advantages and disadvantages for both individuals and companies to shopping online. ,"Nowadays, e-commerce has become popular in our society. For many people, it has become a trend in buying online. However, there are pros and cons in deciding to do this. In this essay, I will discuss some of the reasons why online shopping has positives and some of the challenges to be overcome.  Let's begin by looking at the advantages of online purchases. One of the main reasons why people are inclined to shop online is for discounts. In other words, the product they purchase is relatively cheaper compared to buying it in a conventional method. Let's take Flipkart as an example, the company offers huge discounts on all categories of products ranging from clothing to groceries. During this Diwali season, their offers were so tempting that my whole family did their shopping online. Another reason why individuals prefer online shopping is that they could finish their shopping at convenience from home. Finally, many companies profit from e-commerce, especially no rental cost for their showrooms. For example, One Plus, the mobile company sells its products online only. This indicates that both individuals and companies are benefitted from e-commerce.  Turning to the other side of the argument, there are few disadvantages to online shopping. First, the customers won't be assured that the product they buy is genuine. In a recent survey, more than fifty percent of customers were cheated with either by sending the wrong item or by sending used one. Secondly, e-commerce is making people less social. For instance, when I do shopping with my family, we not only buy things but also have conversations with other people in the store and develop our social network. Online shoppers will be missing the chance of networking with people. Last but not least, companies would need to spend more money on logistics to deliver the product from their warehouse to the delivery address. With an increasing trend in oil and gas rates, companies need to seriously consider. This often leads to a position where conventional shopping is simple and best.  In conclusion, with an uptrend in online shopping by most of the people we need to weigh up the pros of offers provided by companies, and luxury, people can shop from anywhere and cons of customer's confidence of receiving the genuine item to make any further decision",6,6,6,6

The explosive growth of the internet and social media has led to the phenomenon of online shopping and tech savvy consumers are now fulfilling their needs through online shopping. Online shopping affects companies and consumers favourably and has various drawbacks as well.  There are various benefits of online shopping for both buyer and seller. First and foremost is the convenience for the buyer A part from that, online business is also beneficial for the seller as it helps increase his sales and is also cost effective as there are no cost for operating the store and hiring staff. For instance, anyone can book an order online from the comforts of their living room without commuting to the store and waiting in long queues for payments. Moreover, the seller will enjoy more sales as he is operating 24 hours a day and 7 days a week and increased profits due to reduced operating cost.  On the other hand, there are certain pitfalls of e commerce. There is always a risk of fraud which is a cause of concern for both the company and individual. For example, there are various cases of hacking, identity theft, phishing, counterfeit products and other scams that are quite common. Moreover, shipping problems and delays are also a challenge. For instance, a buyer might receive a damaged product or an order might be delivered to a wrong address.  In a nutshell, there are various positive attributes of e commerce such as ease and convenience, cost effectiveness, profitability. On the flip side, it also comes with some downsides.

While it is a prevalent perception that the cessation of local businesses will result in the demise of local communities, I do not support this idea due to the following reasons.  There is a widespread notion that the proliferation of supermarkets will wipe out local communities. However, the reality is that supermarkets can help revitalize the local community. To illustrate, the town where I live always wore a deserted look. This all changed after the inauguration of well-known supermarket chain in my locality. The entire area transformed into a bustling town.  Moreover, supermarkets serve local communities by offering them a range of products at competitive prices. Since supermarkets are bulk buyers, which means that they enjoy economy of scale and are in the position to offer unlimited and diverse products at a cheaper price to their customers. For instance, a member of the local community can find an imported product in a supermarket which might not be available at a local shop which not only gives more choice and freedom to the consumer, but also raises their standard of living manifold.  Furthermore, supermarkets play an active role in the community by creating jobs. For example, a local shop might be managed and operated by a sole proprietor whereas, supermarket chains are mostly corporate entities which employ several hundred even several thousand people.  Therefore, on the basis of aforementioned reasons, it would be justified to say that the positive correlation of the closure of local businesses with the death of local communities is merely a myth. I strongly believe that local communities will thrive as supermarkets flourish",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

What are the advantages and disadvantages for both individuals and companies to shopping online. 9,"Online shopping has become increasingly popular these days and more and more people prefer to shop online instead of going to traditional stores. This trend has both the benefits and drawbacks to customers and retailers in general.  On the one hand, the convenience of buying something online is that customers do not need to walk into a physical store. Instead, retailers are constantly trying to reduce the distance between them and customers' wallet. For example, customers do not have to interact with sales reps who may nudge them towards a particular purchase, or cashiers that pressure them into buying something on top of what's already in their cart, or the physical store itself, which is meticulously designed to subconsciously manipulate customers.  On the other hand, the dark side of online shopping is on the customer manipulation. People may not realize that online shopping is as much a cocktail of manipulative strategies, on the part of vendors, by gathering data from shoppers and competitors to make decisions. For instance, a seller adjusts the price for a buyer, according to attributes such as the customer's eagerness to buy the item, the seller's history with them, the supply of the item, the demand of the item. Nevertheless, customers would riot if they found out and retailers would loss trust from them consequently -- a reason preventing online retailers from embracing this strategy. As a substitute, buyers would receive a discount if the seller checked quote from their competitors.  In conclusion, even though online shopping provides many benefits for both consumers and suppliers which can attribute to reduction of visiting distance and convenience, this method has some drawbacks to them such as price adjustment. Though, they may also gain benefits from price discrimination under certain circumstances. ",8,8,8,8

For example, customers can choose the products freely without any influence from the seller. They also do not have to spend so much time and energy on picking those items.

There are several cases in which customers get unmatched products as they are mentioned on the website. Some customers also complain that it is hard for them to claim warranties. Another disadvantage is that purchasing items online is not 100% safe. For example, it is reported that credit card scams and privacy violence happen to some customers.

Firstly, people do not have to spend their valuable time and energy on an online store, which provide shoppers with a feature of quick search in a particular keyword, in contrast to a physical store.

Secondly, it is known that online stores offer huge discounts for the online shoppers, especially on special days such as Mother's Day, New Year Eve, and Valentine's Day.

These criminals, for instance, stole nearly 500 million dollars between 2017 and 2018, according to the official statistics. In addition, online shopping occurs in a virtual world.

The principle problem farmers are having due to the high demand of foodstuff is grow a higher quantity from the same amount of soil they have.

Another measure would be to counter population growth through educational courses for preventing born more kids in each family. These courses can help to keep the population in the range and help to not increase the number of individuals.

To begin with, since people are near to the future, more and more humans have populated this world. For that reason, people are occupying the increasing number of agricultural places to build their habitation. As a result, the manufacturing of crops is very low. For example, in China, the report of an article published in 1970 showed that the Chinese populace reached high level in comparison to the other countries so that citizens changed their agricultural land into their residents, because the inhabitants in cities and towns are quite low, which, consequently, caused on a drastic fall on crop production.

Firstly, governments must organize different types of events, seminars to make people conscious about the increasing number of people that have an adverse effect on the population. For instance, as people are growing at an alarming rate, food production is not soaring, because people tend to build houses, where vegetables should grow. Eventually, Denizens are getting less bread to eat, whereas excessive people in the globe go to sleep without food.

While some underdeveloped nations have reported loss of lives due to food starvation, some developed ones have concerns about food storage. Fortunately, however, there are solutions to deal with these problems.  The major causes for the increase in food demand are population explosion and food wastage. In spite of the economy being low in countries like Africa, there has been an exponential increase in manpower. As a result of this food production cannot meet its demand, therefore, leading to serious issues like starvation. On the other hand, in countries where is economy is very sound there are issues pertaining to food wastage due to unavailability of advanced machinery for food storage.  International food council can solve for the scarcity in economically backward countries by increasing the production through modern farming methods. India, for example, has made its food production rise northwards by 15% by adapting to advanced farming technologies.  In developed countries where the wastage of food is high, initiatives should be taken to develop machinery that stores food for longer periods. To illustrate an example, recently the United States and Russia together developed an efficient process that allows food to be preserved for up to 20 days thereby bringing down the wastage by 20%.

Moreover, international organizations, such as the UN, should encourage wealthy countries to export their nutrient products in cheap prices to the poor countries, because it can alleviate the situation. For example, the UN can create a new branch, which can regulate this problem.  To conclude, although population is increasing and climatic changes have damaged the current supply of food, food market can be stimulated. In this regard, international aid and new technologies can partly solve this issue. ",8,8,8,8
,Demand for food is increasing worldwide. What is the cause of this? What measures can the international community take to meet this demand? ,"It is argued that the request for the food production is inclining globally. This essay will suggest that the biggest problems of this phenomenon are not only an increase in the rate population, but also an inappropriate and then it will discuss the possible solutions that can be utilized by the international community to eradicate this problem.  To embark on, the major reason of this problem is that the population is growing at an exponential rate because of which more and more land, which were once used for agricultural purposes are being used to build buildings as a result of which there is a scarcity of land, where food can be grown. So, there is a shortage of food in many parts of the world because the production of the food is less, while the populace, who need the food to eat is more. Moreover, In some countries, climate does not support the growth of vegetables, fruits, crops, et cetera. So, these nations are entirely dependent on others to get something to eat. Thus, it also leads to the increase in the demand for the food.  On the other hand, these problems can curb out by the international community by taking some initiatives. Firstly, they should make people aware about the land, that is good for agriculture should not be used for building houses or any industries and it should be used only to produce food. Thus, with this person will try to save those land which are suitable for the growth of food. Secondly, they should try to encourage the people of those countries, where the production of food is good that rather than wasting food, they should import food to those regions, where inappropriate climate conditions do not support the growth of the food.  To conclude, even though the problem of an increase in the food demand is on the rise due to an alarming rate of population growth and climate conditions, but by making people aware about the reasons behind these problems, these issues can be solved to a great extent.

,Demand for food is increasing worldwide. What is the cause of this? What measures can the international community take to meet this demand? ,"One of the major concerns all over the world is whether the agricultural sector can meet the growing demand for food worldwide. This issue is caused due to two main causes - the ever increasing society and extreme changes in climatic conditions. However, it can be resolved through appropriate measures.  The growing demand for cooking is caused by the ever increasing populace. Actually, over the last 50 years, there was a drastic increase in human culture. In fact, world public is expected to increase from 7. 9 billion in 2017 to 9. 7 billion by 2050. Unfortunately, cuisine production has not kept pace with. Climatic changes happening due to various reasons like depletion of ozone layer, acid rain and global warming have led to a decrease in the production of foodstuff.  However, this situation could be remedied by farmers by increasing the area under cultivation and by using improved farming techniques. For example, yield can be increased by using quality fertilizers, improved methods of irrigation and modern techniques called precision farming. In addition to this, the government needs to take active participation in educating farmers about the use of such techniques and products. The international community also needs to step in. Countries where food is surplus must show the willingness to export it to poor countries at a nominal price. This  will ensure that everyone irrespective of their financial situation or nationality has access to three square meals a day.  In conclusion, though the  population is increasing and climatic changes have damaged the current supply of food by using improved farming techniques and bringing more area under cultivation, food production can be stimulated.

,Demand for food is increasing worldwide. What is the cause of this? What measures can the international community take to meet this demand? ,"One of the widely discussed issues nowadays is inquiry of nutrition around the world. It is undeniable that lack of food has become an essential part or our life. In this academic essay, problems and solution will be discussed.  One of the main aspects of the problem are the unrestricted population growth and climate conditions. For example, at the present day world's demographics occupies 7. 8 billion inhabitants, however this indicator after 30 years, according to the United Nations report, is going to reach 9. 8 billion. Unfortunately, it seems that food supplies cannot sufficiently feed the world's population in some areas. In addition, changing weather conditions affect on crop farming development each and every year. For instance, global warming and following ozone layer depletion have led to a significant reduction of the annual harvest.  One of the possible solution for this issue is engaged in greater government's investments in science and research to expand agricultural production, especially in poor rural communities, also in education of farmers with the smart technologies. This may be the easiest and so the best way to save our population from famine. As an example, extensive farmland with greenhouses and inputs modern production like as irrigation, chemical fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides will raise crop yield. Moreover, educated farmers will know better how to manage to yield.  Having weighed everything mentioned up, we can come to a conclusion that sustain the global market food and feed our society, government should funding for agricultural development in poor rural states. So it would not be surprising to see some greenhouses with the smart agricultural techniques in near future. Actions must be taken urgently, otherwise we will get global famine and lose our fuel of life. ",8,8,8,8
,Demand for food is increasing worldwide. What is the cause of this? What measures can the international community take to meet this demand? 0,"That request for nutrition is soaring in all over the world is one of the most utterly debated issues in modern society. The objective of this essay is to investigate the factors which have contributed to this problem and also point out a number of means to resolve the situations.  On the one hand, the are numerous reasons why demand for food is climbing universal is because population grow on a regular basis. For instance, 5 decades ago, the population of the world stood at 6 billion; however, in 2020 this figure reach at 8 billion, as a result of which it is burdensome for food production to keep pace with overpopulation. Another convincing argument is that a plethora of natural phenomena such as the depletion of ozone layer, acid rain and global warming can also lead to a decrease of producing food. Furthermore, restaurants and cafes are observed to waste a great amount of food on a daily basis.  Nevertheless, there are a variety of viable solutions to address this issue. In order to deal with the problem of demand for food, certain measures should be taken by governments. First and foremost, if farmers are ensured with a great number of chemical substances and fertilizers by authorities, it can enhance productivity of land, owing to which the demand for food may decline. The second point to note is that the international community should endeavour to solve this demand. In other words, countries where food is produced should sell their products to poor and third world countries at nominal price, which can reduce requests for food in destitute country. Moreover, employers of restaurants and cafes should be educated to prevent wasting of food by government.  By way of conclusion, population growth and several environmental are the main reasons for request for food being surging in all words; conversely, providing farmers with chemical substances and selling lower cost can solve this problem. Elaborate precautions need to be taken to prevent this problem from deteriorating further. ",8,8,8,8
,Demand for food is increasing worldwide. What is the cause of this? What measures can the international community take to meet this demand? 1,"Food is deemed as the basic necessity for living beings and its demand is growing globally. This essay will discuss that the increasing population and the climate change are the main reasons for the high demand for food and suggest that adopting new farming methods can help the international community to meet this requirement.  Over the last century, global population has quadrupled and according to the most recent estimate by the UN, there are 7. 3 billion people, which may reach 9. 7 billion by 2050. This growth along with rising incomes in developing countries may cause dietary changes such as consumption of more protein and meat. As a consequence, this may lead to driving up more worldwide food demand. Furthermore, the rise in temperature due to climate change will have severe long-term effects on the crop fields. For example, a recent research exhibits that countries which are located near the equator, will face a huge reduction in crop output because of alterations in weather and temperature. Hence, increasing number of citizens and changing climatic conditions are the main causes of growing necessity of sustenance in numerous countries around the world.  The be-all and end-all solution to this problem is to increase the amount of agricultural land for growing grains. Farmers should allocate more areas to cultivate plants, fruits and vegetables rectify this issue. Moreover, farmers should enhance the productivity by using irrigation methods and latest techniques, such as precision farming. Therefore, the most viable solution to this issue of meeting global food demand can be achieved by either using large area for cultivating crops or improving the farming strategies in the existing land.  In conclusion, population increase and climate change are directly proportional to the high demandd of sustenance. It is recommended that governments should provide more land to the agriculturalists and educate them about the latest technologies which are useful in agriculture",8.5,8.5,8.5,8.5
,"Many goverments think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people, however think that other tpes of progress are equally important for a countr. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion ","It is crucial to consider which fields the government should develop. While some believe that economic progress is the most important one, I would argue that, even though it is vital, other kinds of stride must be evenly encouraged.  Firstly, it is necessary to acknowledge that economic development is indispensable for a nation. The reason for this is that economic development is likely to determine the population's quality of life. For example, a country which has a powerful economy, such as the USA, can offer a better life to its inhabitants than Peru, whose economy is weaker and smaller. Therefore, if a nation focuses on progressing economically, their citizens will be happier.  Nevertheless, one might defend that cultural and political progress are equally relevant to improve a country. This is because those realms doesn't only affect the satisfaction of a society, but also exerts an influence on economic advancement. For instance, a person who has a rich and fun culture may feel more vigorous to work and, thus, produce more than a dissatisfied person. Moreover, having a representative and responsible leadership for the nation means that the economical advance will continue. In contrast, if a country does not care about how it is managed, all its advances in the economical field may be loosened in a few years.  In conclusion, although it is of critical importance that a government has economic progress, it is my firm belief that other kinds of improvement, such as the cultural and political ones, should have similar importance.

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. ","Nowadays, the world is witnessing the dramatic development of many countries, especially in economic field. It is said that the most essential purpose of a nation is the developed economic progress. Others believe that progresses of other fields play equal roles as economy. In my opinion, I agree with the latter statement.  On the one hand, flourish economy can bring about many benefits. Strong economy can provide a country ability to improve facilities, infrastructure and so on which can lead to the situation that living standard of citizens can be improved. For example, in developed economy, there will be a great deal of employment as well as the refurbishment of the hospitals and transport system. Moreover, the strength of economic conditions can emphasize the position of a countries in international scale which can bring about many opportunities for more flourish economy and stable national security. Therefore, economic development is one of the most essential parts of a country.  On the other hand, there are other fields that play balanced role as economy which support the development of economy in the best conditions. First and foremost, balancing the society is another part that countries should take into consideration. Narrowing the gap between the poor and the rich, guarantee the internal security of a nation and preventing the bad news released by reactionary organizations from citizens and so on are the necessary measures need the attraction of governments which can surely be solved radically by a great deal of money. Another point, investing in education is the key process of a nation for long-term improvement. This process can guarantee the ability of future leaders and individuals to manage and contribute for the nation in the next years.  In conclusion, although economic development brings about many positive aspects, other process like society and education should be taken into accounts for sustainable evolution of a country.

,"Many government think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country. Discuss both views and give your opinion. ","The importance and popularity of economic growth have become the main aim of government in a past few years. Experts throughout developed and developing worlds have debated whether the economic progress is the most important point or not. Both sides of this issue will be examined in the following essay.  On the one hand, there are three possible reasons that why the growth of the economy is the most government's consideration of this planet. The most important one is that employment creation, resulted from a higher GDP and. An extensive study by renowned university has illustrated that job security will create an income to the household and eventually increase the population's happiness. Furthermore, as the activity of the country as a whole rises, it results in an increase of productivity and country's wealth which link to the happiness of the population. Last but not least, we cannot deny that facility is one type of economic progress. The best example for this is the public transportation methods which facilitate the human life to be more convenient, shorten commute time and cost saving.  On the other hand, although there are ample reasons of an importance of economic progress, its multifold arguments cannot be denied. First and the foremost, there are various kinds of happiness such as well-being, security and time for relaxation. Hence, the government should not pay all attention in economic growth but should also pay attention to what the population really needs. Another point that should be taken into consideration is a health issue. Due to the fact that the cost of hospital bills has an increasing trend over time, resulted to unfold by low-income employees. Therefore, government should establish the hospital to be more accessible. The income gap is the final issue that should be concerned. The reason behinds this is that economic growth is one crucial cause of widening income gap. The rich become richer and the poor become poorer which is resulted in happiness index goes down despite an economic index goes up.  To conclude from aforementioned arguments, I personally believe that the other kinds of growth are important as same as economic growth, especially income gap and health accessibility. ",6,6,6,6
